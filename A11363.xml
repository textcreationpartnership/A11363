            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether there was euer any ſuch place as Paradiſe, or rather the deſcription of Moſes is to be vnderſtood Allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callie, and ſo to be referred vnto the minde onely.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S there is nothing in nature ſo plain which may not be contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, neyther any thing ſo pure which may not be defiled, ſo nothing ſo euident in Gods Worde, which hath not beene oppoſed. Such is our nature after our fall, and ſuch our daily moſt lamentable lapſes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our firſt lapſe, and originall Fall. Inſomuch, that ignoring the cauſe of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17022:10"/> our infinite miſery, we become deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſicke, and of our ſelues and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without remedy. Wherfore my intent beeing chiefly to ſhew vs our end, and eternall felicity, I will firſt ſhew the place, and demonſtrate the grace from which we fell; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by knowing the infelicity of our fall, and place from which we fel, we may be more thankfull vnto God for that felicity, place, and grace, vnto which we are exalted after our fall; and ſo come to a more perfect bleſſednes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our fall, then that which wee poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed before we fell, or ſhould haue poſſeſſed in Paradiſe if wee had not falne. Now therefore as touching this place of our firſt happineſſe, and from whence our miſery was firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued, I will begin with a worthy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, who though hee was one of the chiefeſt Doctors of the Church of God, yet being to explicate theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficulties of Paradiſe,<note place="margin">Ambroſius de Parady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipio capitis primi.</note> was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to acknowledge his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. <hi>De Paradiſo adoriendus ſermo, non mediocrem nobis oestum videtur in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutere,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17022:10"/> quid nam ſit Paradyſus, et vbi ſit, qualiſue ſit inueſtigare &amp; explanare cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientibus: maxime Apoſtolus ſiue in corpore, ſiue extra corpus neſciat, raptu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſe tamen dicat vſ<expan>

                  <hi>idem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que teſtetur ſe ibi audiuiſſe arcana verba, quae non licet homini loqui.</hi> Being to ſpeake (ſaith this Father) of Paradiſe, it doth not a litle trouble me to ſearch out and explane what Paradiſe is; where it is; &amp; what manner of place it is; eſpecially ſeeing the Apoſtle ſaith, that he was rapt thither into the third heauen, where hee heard ſuch things as bee not lawfull for any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man to vtter.</p>
               <p>By which words he ſignifieth two things; the firſt, that, that place was Paradiſe, vnto which S. <hi>Paul</hi> was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried (the which opinion in what ſenſe it may bee verified, it ſhall afterward be explicated) the ſecond thing there to be noted is, that it is impoſſible for man to declare, what kinde of place that was, vnto which the Apoſtle was carried, vnleſſe peraduenture it might haue been by him, who had that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17022:11"/> priuiledge, to be carried thither.</p>
               <p>Hence peraduenture it is that <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes, Philo,</hi> the <hi>Hermetians</hi> and <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> were of opinion, that there was neuer any ſuch place as Paradiſe, but rather that the ſcripture where it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention of Paradiſe, is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood Metaphorically, Spiritually, or Allegorically.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe in other places of Scripture, where there is mention of Paradiſe, that word cannot be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of any terrene place: therefore if one place of Scripture muſt bee the interpreter of the other, according to the common conſent of the Fathers, it may not ſeem improbable, but that the like may be admitted in this hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe thoſe things which are ſaid to haue beene in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, cannot be vnderſtood literally: as that in the midſt of Paradiſe there was a tree of knowledge of good and euill (a property not due vnto nature, much leſſe agreeable or conſequent to the nature of a tree). Secondly, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17022:11"/> 
                  <hi>Adam</hi> heard the voyce of GOD, where as ſpirits of their owne nature haue no voyce, or ſound, much leſſe the pureſt of ſpirits. Thirdly, that hee heard God walking towards the South, whereas indeed God neither walketh, nor moueth, but is alwaies repleniſhing, working, and filling e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery place, yea in euery place equally preſent, in eſſence equall, in power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, in all his other infinit attributes equall.</p>
               <p>Againe, how can it be vnderſtood literally, that after the tranſgreſſion, and expulſion of <hi>Adam</hi> out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, there was placed a Cherub or Angell with a fiery ſword, as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the cuſtody of the ſaid place: as though eyther the commaundement of God had not beene ſufficient, or his will reſiſtible without the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Angelicall power; or the Angell not ſufficiently powerfull for the reſtraining of <hi>Adam,</hi> without the vſe of a fiery ſword; as though againe God in power were not omnipotent, neyther the Angell ſpirituall, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17022:12"/> that the creator had neede of his creature, or that which is a pure ſpirit had need in his operation of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, imperfect and corruptible bodie.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Moſes Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephas tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatu de Paradyſo.</note>
                  <hi>Moſes Barſephas</hi> in his Treatiſe of Paradiſe ſaith, that there be two parts of Paradiſe, one corporall, another ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, one created for the pleaſure of the body, another for to delight the ſoule: ſo that, as man is compoſed of two parts, the one ſpirituall, the other corporall, and yet but one onely man: ſo (ſaith hee) was Paradiſe partly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, and partly ſpirituall, yet one onely Paradiſe: his arguments bee theſe.</p>
               <p>If Paradiſe were onely corporall (ſaith hee) then the body onely of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was delighted there: becauſe no corporall thing can delight the ſoule: wherefore if God had not created a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother part of Paradiſe ſpirituall, hee might ſeem to haue dealt fraudulent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with man (which were blaſphea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous) who promiſed a Paradiſe for the whole man; and yet created ſuch
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17022:12"/> a one as could not delight the whole man.</p>
               <p>Againe, that Paradiſe is not onely ſpirituall, he proueth with theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: For then it could not haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted the body, but onely the ſpirit. Yea all thoſe things which <hi>Moſes</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth as touching Paradiſe, might bee deemed falſe; ſeeing that hee ſo eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently inſinuateth, that man was created in Paradiſe, as in ſome mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall place; and that God had planted Paradiſe in Eden from the beginning: that he put man there whom hee had created, that he created for him there all trees, hearbs, beaſts, and all other things neceſſary, both for the delight and vſe of man: That our firſt Fathers fell from Gods grace, by eating of the forbidden fruite; that they hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues amongſt the trees of Paradiſe, after their fall; and many other things which cannot be vnderſtood, but of a reall and corporall place.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if Paradiſe were not a reall and corporall place, how could there flow out of it thoſe foure riuers, which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17022:13"/> (as the Scripture witneſſeth) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the whole earth? How ſhould <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> be tranſlated thither, and (as many writers affirme) be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued there both in body and ſoule? yea otherwiſe how ſhould <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> haue liued there?</p>
               <p>Which things, though all of them bee not ſo certaine, yet moſt of them are ſo euidently expreſſed in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that they manifeſtly prooue the Garden of Paradiſe to haue beene a reall and corporall place,<note place="margin">Chryſoſtom. hom. <hi>13.</hi> in geneſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THIS may ſeeme as ſtrange a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to ſome, as how to meaſure the latitude of the heauens, the depth of the Sea, or how to number the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable ſtarres of the firmament, yea much more; ſeeing that of theſe we haue ſome ſight, ſome experience, ſome naturall ground; but of this of Paradiſe, we haue no view, no expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, nor any naturall foundation ſufficient to build ſuch mighty ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinas of conceipts, as ſome doe more boldly, then ſoundly conceiue of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe.</p>

                  <hi>Paradyſe is a place ſituated in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entall parts of the world, whoſe aetimology (the word beeing tranſlated out of Greeke into Latin,) ſignifieth</hi> hortum <hi>a Garden.

               <p>Theſe be the common opinions of the Fathers, &amp; doctors in theſe points; to which euery man may aſſent as he findeth moſt agreeable with reaſon and true Philoſophy, for ſeeing that in theſe poynts there is nothing reuealed or declared vnto vs in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17022:17"/> nature muſt bee the beſt guide and miſtreſſe, where ſupernaturall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is wanting.</p>
               <p>Out of which naturall principles that of the huge hight of Paradiſe, and reaching of it euen vnto the Spheare of the Moone, ſeemeth altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable; for if Paradiſe was made for the habitation, yea for the delight of man, why ſhould it bee ſituated in ſo inconuenient a place, yea (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to naturall reaſon) na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally not inhabitable by reaſon of the neereneſſe of the Sunne, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Planets, and ſtars.</p>
               <p>To which (I cannot denie) but ſome ſhew of anſwere may be made as that neither Sunne, nor any of the Planets, are (as the Philoſophers ſay) formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but onely virtually hot; that is, though they haue the vertue to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce heate in theſe inferiour things, yet that they be not in themſelues hot, neither are they capable of heate: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as they neither agree in matter, nor forme (as many Philoſophers hold) with theſe inferiour creatures;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17022:18"/> ſo neither can they haue the ſame kinde of qualities that our Elements haue.</p>
               <p>But this anſwer is eaſily confuted, becauſe as the virtuall heate of the ſun is ſufficient to make inhabitable ſome places of the world (as diuers graue Writers affirme) by reaſon of the neerneſſe vnto it, why might it not alſo cauſe the like effect in Paradiſe? vnleſſe wee will flie vnto the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of God, and miracles, the onely refuge of ill grounded Philoſophie and ignorance.</p>
               <p>Or ſay (as ſome haue fondly fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that Paradiſe being of another kinde of matter then the reſt of the earth, or of the ſame Species, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the heauens are, as theſe bee incorruptible by reaſon of their moſt pure matter, or incorruptible vnion, ſo likewiſe Paradiſe, and the thinges there: onely man being of the ſame nature that now he is, was by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular prouidence of the omnipotent power, kept from mortalitie or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption as long as hee preſerued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17022:18"/> from the corruption of ſin. But theſe and ſuch like ſolutions, as they are forged without any ground, ſo they may eaſily be denied without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more reaſon, this onely being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the former proofe, that ſo high a place as the Spheare of the Moone, was altogether vnfit for the ſituation of Paradiſe, by reaſon of the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al agitation, and motion of that place, which is ſo continually rapt, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about with the moſt violent, and ſwift courſe of the heauen. Many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſons (I confeſſe) might bee giuen, but which rather appertain vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Mathematikes and longer diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, then the breuity, which wee haue here taken vpon vs, will permit.</p>
               <p>Now therefore onely remaineth that by the conſideration of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of this place, wherein we were before our ſinne, we gather the hatred God beareth to ſinne; ſeeing that for the ſinne of one, yea and that but one only, God, who is ſo good, yea infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite goodneſſe and mercie, would pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh with ſo long a puniſhment, and

And laſtly we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, what ſinne iuſtly deſerueth, if it ſhould not be puniſhed more accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule of mercy, then accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that, which the rigor of iuſtice requireth; ſeeing that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was, or could bee ſufficient, to blot, or waſh it away, but onely the bloud of the lambe of God, which onely waſheth away the ſinnes of the world; by which, we are to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, not onely into a more high parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of God, and his grace, then we poſſeſſed before our fall; but alſo into a more perfect Paradiſe, then that was, from which we were baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for our firſt ſinne, and fall: And this only by his merits, bloud, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17022:19"/> paſſion, who could in no wiſe either ſlippe, or fall: So that wee may well exclaime with Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi>

               <p>The anſwere vnto both is eaſie, but firſt vnto the firſt. I grant that if wee had not ſinned, onely the elect ſhould haue beene created, and placed in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe: whence without any ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to mortalitie, or other things, now neceſſarily annexed thereunto, they ſhould haue been tranſlated vnto their ſupernaturall felicity in heauen; but it followeth not hence that they could be ſo few in number, as might well be contained in ſo little a compaſſe, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe is imagined to be.</p>
               <p>Neither, becauſe it is ſaid, that ſmall is the number of the elect, for though they be ſo in compariſon of the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17022:22"/> (in which ſenſe the fathers inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret that place) yet abſolutely they be many, yea without queſtion more, then euer there were men liuing in the world together. For ſo it is euidently gathered out of the Apocalypſe, where the beloued Apoſtle after that he had made mention of twelue thouſand in euery Tribe, ſealed, and ſigned, hee concludeth with theſe words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>And after theſe things I ſaw,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 7.9.</note> 
                  <hi>and behold a great multitude which none could number of all nations, and Tribes, and people, and tongues, ſtanding before the throne, and in the ſight of the Lambe: couered with white ſtoles, and with pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes in their hands:</hi> Now if theſe be the elected (as without doubt they bee) how could they all haue dwelt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at one, and the ſame time in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe? how could they (I ſay) haue beene contained in ſo little a ſpace or garden as Paradiſe is imagined to haue beene? True it is, that man was created to ſupply and repleniſh the ſeates of the fallen Angels: but hence,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17022:23"/> we are rather to inferre the contrary of that which was pretended in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection; becauſe the badde Angels, as the Fathers ſay, and hath been proued in our Treatiſe of Angels, were almoſt innumerable, wherefore if the bleſſed men be to ſupply their places, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede they bee, they muſt neceſſarily be more in number, then could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently inhabite ſo little a place as Paradiſe is imagined to haue beene: ſeeing that, if not all, yet infinite more ſhould haue concurred together, then now poſſibly can after our exile out of Paradiſe; whence all occaſions of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie ſhould haue beene remooued, and where the tree of life ſhould haue beene ſufficient for the preſeruation of mans life; if not for all eternitie (as many haue ſaid) yet for many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of yeeres, or at leaſt for a farre longer ſpace, then now the life of man can naturally bee prolonged, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the naturall cauſes which then were more forcible, or of more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, for mans preſeruation, and none nociue to man, as long as hee was not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17022:23"/> hurtfull vnto himſelfe, the ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cauſe of cauſes did particularly concurre in this, as well by his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular prouidence, as by the vertue of the tree of life.</p>
               <p>Now to the ſecond obiection, which preſumeth to demand a reaſon of Gods ſecret decrees, and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to wit, why God foreſeeing mans ſinne, and that from all eternity, would create for mans habitation, a place ſo ſpacious, excellent, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which he knew was to be enioyed for ſo ſhort a time? I anſwere with the like obiection, why alſo did he create ſo infinite a number of Angells, with ſo many excellent gifts, as well of grace, as nature, and both <hi>gratis,</hi> yea and heauen ſo beautifull and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a place for them, whom hee knew would ſo ſoone praeuaricate and fall from that felicitie, into the other ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>treame of infelicitie? yea the like I aske of <hi>Adam,</hi> why would God ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne him with all kinde of gifts both naturall and ſupernaturall, whom hee knew <hi>ab aeterno</hi> from all eternitie was
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17022:24"/> preſently to be ſo vngratefull, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to fall from his grace? if theſe things be not vnbeſeeming his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, neither contradict his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and fore-knowledge of future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, neither doth this other of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Paradiſe ſo beautifull, ſpacious, and capable of ſo great a number, whereas God knew from all eternitie that <hi>Adam</hi> by his fall was to looſe that place both for himſelfe, and all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie. The onely reaſon of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion propounded may bee (and the ſame may be applied with proportion vnto the reſt) becauſe, as we finde by ordinarie experience, that God doth not ordinarily deale with man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to future euents, and his diuine preſcience thereof, but according to his owne ſcience of things as preſent,<note place="margin">Aquinas prima parte quaeſt. <hi>14.</hi> Molina, Suarius, Valentia, Vaſquez &amp; alij ſchola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtici.</note> which the Diuines call <hi>ſcientiam viſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> or intuitiue knowledge. Hence it is, that God ſeeing man not vnworthy of that place perſiſting in the grace, in which he was created, according to the preſent eſtate hee had created him in, therefore (I ſay) not reſpecting
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17022:24"/> mans future demerits, but his owne preſent grace, as he beſtowed originall Iuſtice vpon him, to be tranſlated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his poſteritie, ſo likewiſe hee gaue this ſo excellent and capable a place as a ſufficient and apte habitation for him, and his poſteritie, if they had not falne from his grace.</p>
               <p>Theſe bee the groundes of <hi>Ephrens</hi> opinion, which to mee is altogether improbable. Wherefore my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this ſo vncertaine a point, is, that though Paradiſe was not ſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as the reſt of the world inhabited, yet that it was of no ſmall compaſſe, which I inferre of the greatneſſe of the fountaine which ſprung there, out of which foure mighty riuers were deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Secondly becauſe there was no neede of any ſuch extraordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe as <hi>Ephren</hi> imagined, ſeeing that it was but to containe the elect onely, which ſhould haue beene but few in compariſon of the multitude which now poſſeſſe the face of the earth. Neither was it neceſſary that all beaſts ſhould remaine there; becauſe man
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17022:25"/> in that happie eſtate had no ſuch need of their ſeruice, as now he hath.</p>

But theſe are but vncertaine coniectures in things, which are not ſo manifeſt in Scripture.</p>
               <p>That which ſeemeth moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this matter, is, that ſeeing the Scripture calleth Paradiſe but a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that ſurely it cannot bee of any ſuch compaſſe as ſome imagine. And ſecondly becauſe it is ſaid to be ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Region of <hi>Heden</hi> in the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne parts, which in no wiſe may be compared with the reſt of the world for greatneſſe.</p>
               <p>Now to the other difficultie aboue inſinuated, whether man perſiſting in the ſtate of innocency, ſhould haue dwelt in any other place, but onely in Paradiſe: I anſwere, that without all doubt hee ſhould, becauſe ſo ſmall a circuit, as Paradiſe was, could not haue beene ſufficient for the habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſo great a multitude, as might
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17022:25"/> very well in one mans age concurre together, for if after the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> ſome men liued all-moſt a thouſand yeeres, certainely if <hi>Adam</hi> had kept his originall iuſtice, he ſhould in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood haue tripled the time (as <hi>Villal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pandus</hi> affirmeth) or liued much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then hee did after he ſinned in which ſpace there muſt needes haue been allmoſt an infinite number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and conſequently the place of their habitation muſt needes haue beene of correſpondent ſpace, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie, wherefore ſeeing that Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe (as wee haue already ſhowne) was of no ſuch capacitie, as was apt for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taining of ſuch a multitude, it is not likely that man ſhould haue beene confined there onely, vntill the time of his tranſlation into a more happy eſtate, which ſhould haue bin after his ſufficient triall in the terrene Paradiſe, according to the free diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and decree of his Creator.</p>

               <p>And this the rather becauſe in the 44 Chapter of <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> it is ſaid <hi>that</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch <hi>was tranſlated into Paradiſe that he might be a patterne of penance vnto the Gentiles.</hi> Therefore if <hi>Henoch</hi> be there as yet, yea as a patterne of penance vnto the Gentiles, there muſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee an earthly Paradiſe, but alſo it ſeemeth that it muſt be a place habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or to which men may haue ſome acceſſe, in ſuch ſort, that they may ſee their patterne of repentance, for if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the place be deſtroyed, inacceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or inuiſible, how can it bee true

               <p>Theſe be the arguments of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and for which many doe not thinke it improbable: neuer the leſſe (all the places of Scriptures and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, together with their reaſons well pondered) it ſeemeth much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that Paradiſe, in which <hi>Adam</hi> was created is not now to bee found, but rather that it was deſtroyed by the generall deluge.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe the Scripture <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. Chap: ſaith, that all mountaines were couered with the waters of the flood, <hi>à fortiori</hi> therefore this pleaſant Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Garden was therby ouer-flowne.</p>
               <p>But peraduenture, this was a whole Region higher then any Mountaine, and conſequently though all Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines were couered, yet this place might be ſafe, as which was the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that bleſſed man <hi>Henoch:</hi> or
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17022:30"/> peraduenture though it was not ſo high, yet was it reſerued for the ſaid reaſon by Gods particular proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>

               <p>But ſuppoſing that the contrarie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is probable, to wit, that Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe is as yet extant, not onely accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the place it ſelfe, but alſo to the beauty and pleaſure which the Scripture teſtifieth it had, at the firſt creation; it may well bee inquired, what ſhould be the reaſon why it hath neuer been diſcouered of any amongſt ſo many as haue compaſſed the world.</p>
               <p>Some as I haue already touched, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that the reaſon is, becauſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17022:30"/> God offended with <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, hath inuironed it with huge Hills, mightie mountaines, ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſeas, fearefull rockes, and great wilderneſſes full of all kinde of terrible beaſts, and venemous Serpents, ſo that it is impoſſible for any mortall man to paſſe thither.</p>
               <p>Others againe anſwere that Paradiſe hath not beene diſcouered, neither ſought for by Infidels, becauſe they thought it to be but a fable, neither by the faithfull or Chriſtians; becauſe they know it to be inacceſſible. But if I may interpoſe my opinion and freely ſpeake what I iudge in this matter, I think that none of theſe reaſons are ſo concludent and certaine as that the place of Paradiſe is as yet vnknowne by the particular diſpoſition and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God; as part of our puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for that ſinne, for which wee were baniſhed thence, as not only vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to inhabite the place it ſelfe, but alſo of the notice where it was. Or ſecondly becauſe it is not in any wiſe neceſſary to bee knowne, either
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17022:31"/> as belonging to the furtherance of our felicity in this mortall life, or to the obtaining of the eternall happines in the other immortall. As in like manner this alſo was the reaſon, why though our Sauiour knew at leaſt way by ſupernaturall meanes, and as he was the eternall wiſedome of God, the time of the end of this world, and of his ſecond comming to iudgement, yet becauſe this was not neceſſary for man to know, therefore hee denied the reuelation thereof euen vnto his Apoſtles: inſomuch that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaid <hi>Act.</hi> 1. cap. verſ. 7. <hi>vnto his Apoſtles, that it was not for them to know the times or ſeaſons which the Father hath put in his owne power.</hi> So neither is it for vs, too curiouſly to inquire after this place of Paradiſe, which God hath either deſtroyed, or hidden from vs, as part of our puniſhment for our firſt and originall offence in that place.</p>

               <p>Yea, which is more, God himſelfe alſo commanded <hi>Adam</hi> that he ſhould eate of euery tree of Paradiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.16. excepting the tree of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and euill: conſequently euery tree of Paradiſe was fruitfull, if fruitfull, queſtionleſſe then pleaſant both to taſt and ſight.</p>
               <p>I dare not condemne this opinion, becauſe it hath authours of no ſmall authority, neuertheleſſe to me it is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vnprobable: ſeeing there be many fruitfull trees not very beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: and many moſt beautifull,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:17022:32"/> though not fruitefull.</p>
               <p>It is therefore more conformable both to reaſon and the ſacred text alſo, that it be vnderſtood diſiunctiuely: to wit, that there was trees of both ſorts, ſome beautifull, ſome fruitfull, ſome both. Yea, this is plaine out of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> 31, the 8. verſe. <hi>where both the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar and Firre trees altogether vnfruitfull, are named as trees of Paradiſe, to whom the glory of the Aſſirian was thus compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the Cedars in the Garden of God could not hide him, the Firre trees were not like his boughes, and the Cheſnut trees were not like his branches, nor any tree in the garden of God was like vnto him in his beauty.

               </argument>
               <p>SVch was the bounty of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man in the happy eſtate of Paradiſe, that he did not only giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him what was neceſſary or conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for his naturall eſtate there, but alſo added other moſt extraordinarie meanes and helpes both naturall and ſupernaturall, conuenient and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie for both his eſtates of nature and grace; ſuch was this of the tree of life, which (as ſome well note) according to the originall text, was called the tree or wood, not <hi>of life</hi> onely, in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, but in the plurall, <hi>of liues,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ſo to lengthen the life of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man, that euery ſingular and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular mans life, might well ſeame
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17022:33"/> the life, not of one onely man, but of many.</p>
               <p>Whereby we may firſt admire the power of Almighty God, ſecondly his goodneſſe towards man: his power in the creating of ſuch a fruite: his goodneſſe, in beſtowing it vpon him, whom he knew was in ſo ſhort a time after, to be ſo vngratefull for that, and many other moſt excellent, as well na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, as ſupernaturall gifts.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon, why it is tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the tree of liues, is, becauſe as a man hath three liues, virtually: if not really diſtinct, the ſenſitiue, vegetatiue, and rationall; ſo this fruite of the tree of liues ſhould haue had vertue to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified all three, in which alſo we may note the wiſedome of God, but more againe his mercy: his wiſedome in that hee knew to produce incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at leaſt way for many yeares if not eternall (as many hold) by a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all repairing of nature by the eating of the ſaid apple; but more againe (I ſay) may we admire his mercy, and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, by which he ſought meanes to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternize

                     <hi>Man.</hi> 17.</note> where (as Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaith) they were to poſſeſſe in a more perfect meaſure, and that through all eternity <hi>ioy without ſorrow, reſt without labour, honour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare, wealth without damage; health without ſickneſſe; aboundance without care; life with all ſecurity; immortalitie without corruption; all happineſſe with no miſerie at all. Where all perfection is in the higheſt degree, and all imperfections remote; where ſight is face vnto face, where perfect knowledge, and nothing vnreuealed of which humane nature can be capable; where Gods ſoueraigne good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe raigneth ſuper omnia aboue al things,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17022:34"/> and the light enlightening is glorified of the Saints; where the preſent maieſtie of the Almightie is perpetually beholden, and the minde of the beholders eternally filled with this fruit of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, it was called the tree of life, or liues; becauſe it did after a double manner ſuſtaine and renew the life of man: firſt in reſtoring our naturall moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, by which wee liue, which conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth euery day more and more by our naturall heat, which was a proprietie common alſo to all other fruits of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in that which was proper to this tree only, and for which it was particularly tearmed the tree of life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was of ſuch qualities and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent proprieties, that being eaten, it did renew our <hi>humidum radicale,</hi> our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall humiditie and moiſture, whereby wee ſhould haue liued with the like or equall puritie and perfection, which had beene in man at his firſt creation; yea it ſhould haue ſo fortified our naturall heat, that although it did naturally ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſome detriment and loſſe by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17022:35"/> action, yet ſhould it haue beene ſo ſtrengthned by that fruit of life, that it could neuer haue decaied or periſhed, and conſequently man could neuer die corporally in that happy eſtate, vnleſſe hee had firſt killed himſelfe ſpiritually by being partaker of the forbidden fruit, inſomuch that the diſobedience of one brought in by concupiſcence was the cauſe of all our miſery and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, that ſo God of his meere good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe through his infinite wiſedome might thereby take occaſion of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his mercy vpon thoſe who after <hi>Adams</hi> fall were nothing but miſerie, and by the obedience of his deareſt Sonne might repaire and redeeme the diſobedience of vs moſt accurſed cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifes: ſo that wee participating of the fruit of the tree of life communicated vnto vs in the ſacred communion by vertue of that tree of life prefigured in this Paradiſe, might thereby be reuiued from a temporall death to an eternitie of bleſſedneſſe, and perpetuitie of a moſt bleſſed life; yea ſo by occaſion of our firſt ſinne, gaine more then euer we
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17022:35"/> had obtained if we had not ſinned: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereby we obtained that fruit of life to be prepared for vs vpon the tree of the croſſe, yea and thence communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs in the ſacred communion, and bread of life, which doubtleſſe wee ſhould not haue obtained, at leaſtway after that manner and meaſure, if wee had not tranſgreſſed. Or at leaſtway Chriſt prefigured in this tree of life, ſhould not haue appeared paſſible as one of vs, if wee by our ſinne had not needed his paſſion. Wherefore we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſtoniſhed at ſo great mercy ſhewne vnto vs in ſo infinite miſerie, and that ſo lamentable a loſſe ſhould be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſo ioyfull and infinite gaine, we may well exclaime with <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, <hi>O foelix culpa, quae talem &amp; tantum habere meruit Redemptorem,</hi> O happy fall, and happy vnhappineſſe, which was occaſion of ſo great happineſſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the aforeſaid tree was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily called the tree of life, or liues; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it did not only preſerue our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall being, by the repairing of our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall forces, but alſo did ſo renew them
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17022:36"/> by a ſupernaturall vertue proceeding thence, that thereby we might haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a life free from all kinde of feares of death, or of any griefes, vexations, or torments, now neceſſarily annexed to both deaths, corporall and ſpirituall, temporall and eternall: now I ſay an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to both deaths, vnleſſe wee haue applied vnto vs the vertue of another tree of life, by whole life all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing haue their being, and by whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence all things liuing haue their life.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that the former was a moſt perfect patterne or repreſentation of the latter, but the latter a more perfect forme then could bee fully repreſented by the former, or by any other poſſible. Neuertheleſſe the tree of life was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the terreſtriall Paradiſe, to the end that it might be a type, and in ſome ſort repreſent that which ſhould be fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented or ſeene in the celeſtiall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by the eternall light of glory, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diuine oracle, <hi>In lumine tuo videbimus lumen,</hi> in thy light wee ſhall ſee light; that is, by and through thy light of glory (which is a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17022:36"/> habit infuſed into our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings) wee ſhall ſee the glorious light of thy eſſence, not comprehenſiuely, which is impoſſible, but moſt perfectly and eſſentially, which is common to all the bleſſed Spirits and Saints of heauen, to euery one according to their degree of glory, correſpondent vnto the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their faith heard here in earth, or while they were in the way to this ſupernaturall bleſſedneſſe.</p>

                  <hi>To him that ouercommeth will I giue to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midſt of the Paradiſe of my God:</hi> that is, as <hi>Eugobinus</hi> in his <hi>Coſmopoeia</hi> holdeth, not our eſſentiall bleſſedneſſe in the ſight of God, as the former opinion is, but a proprietie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily annexed thereunto, to wit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie,

               <p>Here be many fictitious propoſitions ill grounded, and which of themſelues are ſufficient to ouerthrow themſelues: the truth and the common opinion, as well of Schoole Diuines, as of Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of the holy Scriptures and Fathers is, that as the hiſtorie of the tree of life, and the reſt of Paradiſe may well be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted in an Allegoricall ſenſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any contradiction to the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the hiſtorie; ſo to vnderſtand it only thus, excluding the hiſtorie, is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt iniurie done to the Scripture.

               <argument>
                  <p>Why the tree of life was ſo called, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it had truly the propertie of making a man immortall.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS it is truly ſaid of the bread of life, the Sacrament (I meane) of the Lords Supper, that it doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre phyſically with any real influence vnto the grace of God inherent in our ſoules in this life, or to the eternitie of bleſſedneſſe in the life to come, but that it is only a ſigne of the one, and a pawne and pledge of the other, to wit, of grace in this life, of an eternall poies of glory in the other: ſo many holding the tree of life to be a figure or type of the bread
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17022:39"/> of life, haue with proportion held of them both, to wit, that neither of them were phyſicall and reall cauſes of their effects, but onely morall. Hence it is that <hi>Eugubinus</hi> aboue alleaged in his <hi>Coſmopoeia</hi> thinketh that it was called the tree of life, <hi>non effectiuè quòd vitam face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret immortalem,</hi> not becauſe it did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cauſe or ſhould haue cauſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie in man; <hi>ſed ſignificatiue tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tùm,</hi> becauſe it ſhould haue beene a ſigne and token only of immortalitie, if he had not tranſgreſſed the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of his Creator: a probable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion certainly, or which cannot eaſily bee refuted; for although all almoſt Writers and Fathers both of the Greeke and Latine Church doe agree, that the effect of this fruit <hi>was immortalitie,</hi> yet in the manner how, they doe not agree. So therefore if wee agree of the thing, it is not materiall how wee hold of the manner of concourſe. As in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wee doubt not to ſay of the bread of life, the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that certainly it containeth the cauſe of life Chriſt, but how it contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17022:39"/> him, who can expreſſe? This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the naturall capacitie of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, the other of the type alſo the reach of man. Agreeing therefore about the things, why ſhould wee ſo contend to expreſſe the manner, which in no wiſe can be expreſſed, becauſe it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the booke of life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be neceſſary to eternall life.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe (if I may coniecture in things ſo hidden) I deeme the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary much more probable, to wit, that this tree of life was not onely a type or token of immortalitie, but that really it was a cauſe ſufficient to haue produced immortalitie: my reaſon, or rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruence (becauſe no concludent reaſon can be giuen in this point) is, becauſe it was the moſt perfect figure (as the Fathers affirme) of that moſt excellent tree, which for all eternitie is planted in the celeſtiall Paradiſe, to wit, of Chriſt, who ſaith of himſelfe,<note place="margin">Apoc. 2. cap.</note> 
                  <hi>Vincenti dabo ede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, to him that ouercommeth</hi> (to wit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) <hi>I will giue to eat,</hi> what will he giue? himſelfe, to eat <hi>of the tree of life, which is in the Paradiſe</hi> of the eternall God, not
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17022:40"/> carnally, as carnall men dreame, but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually in the bread of life, as hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth affirme of himſelfe. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he who is the tree of life, or rather the author of life, or to ſpeake more properly, life it ſelfe, euen as he is in the Sacrament of life, doth heere truly in this miſerable life produce in vs the life of grace, as a preſent pawne of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture glory: ſo it ſeemeth moſt probable that the other tree of life (as a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect figure of this) planted in the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Paradiſe, had the like inherent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, for to perpetuate, or at leaſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the liues of <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as long as they were to liue in that terrene Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>But whether this fruit of the tree of life was ſufficient to perpetuate our life, or only to prolong it for ſome determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate time,<note place="margin">Abulenſis ſuper Geneſ. c. <hi>13.</hi> quaeſt. <hi>175.</hi> Scotus li. <hi>2.</hi> ſent. diſt. <hi>19</hi> quaeſt. <hi>1.</hi> Aquinas <hi>1</hi> p. q. <hi>9.7.</hi> art <hi>4</hi> &amp; Caiet. ibid.</note> many diſpute probably for both opinions.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:17022:40"/> meaſure of nature, this the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall of him who is aboue all nature. Secondly, ſeeing the power of the tree of life was a naturall power and cauſe, the effect could not bee ſupernaturall: for though effects be often inferiour to their cauſes, yet neuer the cauſes vnto the effects; the reaſon, becauſe no cauſe can giue that which it hath not, neither any effect haue any excellencie or perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction not proceeding from the cauſe: wherefore if the tree of life was (as without queſtion it was) a naturall tree, as the Laurell, Cypreſſe, and other trees be, it could not haue as connaturall, the ſupernaturall effect of making eternall the life of man.</p>
               <p>Moreouer it is a principle euen in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall philoſophie, that <hi>omne agens phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicum in agendo patitur &amp; debilitatur,</hi> that euery naturall cauſe doth ſuffer ſome detriment euen in and by his owne acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: conſequently therefore, though our naturall heat and vigour might bee very long conſerued by the vertue of this excellent fruit, yet at length it ſhould haue failed, and thence finally
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17022:41"/> mortalitie ſhould haue followed, as a neceſſary effect of ſo forcible a cauſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it is not likely that God, who is the author and firſt rule of nature, doth produce any thing fruſtrate in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: ſeeing therefore the fall of man was patent vnto him euen from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, to what end ſhould he prouide an eternall cauſe for a temporary effect?</p>
               <p>But if this argument had any force, it ſhould force alſo our aduerſaries to the like, if not a greater inconuenience; for who doubteth but that God knew alſo the little time that man was to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in his grace? and yet neuertheleſſe he gaue him that fruit, which was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the preſeruation of his life for many a yeere, as our aduerſaries hold, why then might hee not likewiſe for all eternitie? is it becauſe of the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie? <hi>at non impoſsibile Deo omne verbum,</hi> to God nothing is impoſſible, which doth not imply contradiction, but what contradiction is in this? is it, that here naturall philoſophie is contradicted? <hi>omne agens in agendo patitur &amp; debilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> euery agent doth decay euen by his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17022:41"/> owne action; but ſeeing the author of nature is aboue nature, why might hee not here worke that which is aboue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? or though in the compaſſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet beyond our naturall capacitie, which is ſo ſmall, that wee ſcarcely or very imperfectly vnderſtand things of farre inferiour degree, yea ſuch as are within our ſelues: why therefore ſhall wee deny vnto God that which we doe not vnderſtand in our ſelues? My reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution therefore is that of <hi>Abulenſis, Propterea dictam eſſe arborem vitae, quòd fructus eius vim haberet ſeruandi homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem à morte in omne tempus, &amp; faciendi eum immortalem,</hi> that this tree was therefore called the tree of life, becauſe it had vertue to perpetuate our naturall life, and the vnion of the body and ſoule for euer, if we had not loſt the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall grace, which was the vnion of our ſoules with God; but ſeeing wee wilfully ſeparated our ſelues from our ſupernaturall life, it was moſt iuſt that wee ſhould alſo be depriued of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall: hence therefore is that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſo often preacheth, <hi>mortem in mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17022:42"/> intraſſe propter peccatum,</hi> that death entred into the world by the doore of ſinne, which doore if we had debarred to ſinne, the grace of God ſhould haue beene a perpetual vnion betweene God and vs, and the tree of life ſhould haue cauſed the like betweene our bodies and ſoules; and this of his owne nature eternally, though <hi>de facto</hi> wee needed it but only temporally, both ſuppoſing our fall, as likewiſe not ſuppoſing any at all; for if we had not fallen or ſinned in our firſt father, wee ſhould certainly after ſome number of yeeres haue been tranſlated from that terrene Paradiſe, which was our firſt though temporary habitation, vnto a more excellent and perpetuall in the kingdome of heauen; and this ſhould haue heene without any aſſault of death, becauſe we had alwaies liued in God, who as hee would then haue preſerued vs by his grace from the corruption of ſinne, would alſo haue preſerued vs from this corruption, which was only the effect of ſinne, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſinne is death:</hi> the wager being the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17022:42"/> deuill, our ſoules are bought and ſold; ſold away for nothing (ſinne being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a priuation of being) but bought againe by the death of the moſt precious of mortall liues, which in no wiſe ſhould haue beene neceſſary, if wee had not beene loſt, or fallen from our firſt grace and innocencie.</p>
               <p>But as that poeticall fiction of the <hi>Nectar</hi> and <hi>Ambroſia</hi> ſeemed to <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> of ſmall ground, ſo this for the like reaſon may ſeeme to bee as fabulous: for as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> argueth againſt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, either the Gods vſed this <hi>Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> and <hi>Nectar</hi> for pleaſure only, or alſo for neceſſitie; if only for pleaſure, how then could <hi>Ambroſia</hi> and <hi>Nectar</hi> be any neceſſary cauſe of their immortalitie? againe, if for neceſſitie, certainly the Gods then had not beene immortall by nature, and conſequently no Gods, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, that which hath need of any thing for his preſeruation muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be mortall.</p>
               <p>After the ſame manner we may argue againſt this fruit of this tree of life, which is ſaid to be ſufficient to cauſe an
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17022:43"/> eternitie of life, <hi>à parte poſt,</hi> as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers ſpeake: for if our immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was onely to be from the tree of life, then queſtionleſſe without it wee had beene mortall, and ſubiect to death; contrary to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Stipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium peccati mors,</hi> the wages of ſinne is death: for whether wee had ſinned, or perſiſted in our primatiue grace, all had beene one, wee ſhould naturally haue taſted of death, if wee had not eaten of the tree of life. Againe, if it was onely <hi>ad melius eſſe,</hi> for a better preſeruation of our immortalitie due vnto that eſtate, and not abſolutely neceſſary for that effect; then conſequently it was not the tree of life in the ſenſe which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inſinuateth, but an antidote onely againſt death, and not a neceſſary cauſe of eternall life.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that though the argument of <hi>Nectar</hi> and <hi>Ambroſia</hi> doth euidently ouerthrow the deitie and immortalitie of the heathen gods, yet doth not the ſimile or compariſon any thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the immortalitie and deitie of the true God, as neither the immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17022:43"/> of our firſt parents, due onely vnto them in their eſtate of innocencie, and which did principally proceed from the true and only immortall God; becauſe that immortalitie of life proceeding from the fruit of life, was to endure no longer with man then man perſeuered in the grace of God, which was giuen him as a pawne of eternall life.</p>
               <p>Neither doth this contradict that of the Apoſtle, <hi>the wages of ſinne is death:</hi> for though death be due vnto man euen without ſinne according to nature, yet this debt was to bee remitted by origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall grace, and the naturall proneneſſe thereunto to be redreſſed by the fruit of life.</p>
               <p>Wherefore though the immediate cauſe of our immortalitie in Paradiſe ſhould haue beene the tree of life, yet the primarie and principall of all, to which the other was conſequent, was originall grace, whoſe immediate effect was our ſpirituall life, and thereto ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily followed the freedome from any corporall harme, or death; yea and this for euer of his owne nature, though
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17022:44"/> wee had not beene tranſlated thence to a better life: for ſo it is ſaid of <hi>Adam,</hi> that therefore hee was baniſhed out of Paradiſe, and interdicted the entrance vnto the tree of life, leſt eating of it hee ſhould liue for euer, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 3. <hi>chap.</hi> 22. <hi>v.

                  <p>Whether the vertue of the tree of life to preſerue man immortall was naturall vnto it, or ſupernaturall.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>LEſt wee erre in the reſolution of this queſtion by any equiuocation of words, as it falleth out often in the like difficulties of naturall and ſupernaturall obiects; I will firſt declare how the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines vſe this diſtinction, and then how it is to be taken here.</p>
               <p>Naturall (as farre forth as is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for our preſent purpoſe) is that which floweth from the principles of nature, to wit, matter and forme, of which, as of their only compacts, all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17022:45"/> and corporal ſubſtances are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
               <p>Supernaturall is that which is aboue all nature, or rather cannot in any wiſe proceed from the principles of nature: but as it is aboue all nature, ſo it flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from that ſole principle which is aboue all nature, if not only, yet princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally.</p>
               <p>Secondly, naturall oftentimes is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>pro congenito,</hi> for that which is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally produced with any other thing, though it flow not in any wiſe from the principles of nature, or bee not due thereunto; ſo no doubt but if an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel were created with the light of glory, or beatificall viſion of Gods eſſence, both the light of glory and the viſion of God ſhould be in that ſenſe naturall, or rather connaturall vnto the Angell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was produced together with his naturall ſubſtance or eſſence. And the ſame oftentimes is auerred by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of man, in regard of his originall iuſtice, in which hee was created: for though this original iuſtice did not flow from the principles of nature, yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17022:45"/> becauſe it was produced with nature by Almightie God, and infuſed into mans nature, as due vnto it in that happy eſtate, therefore it is, and may well be termed <hi>naturall,</hi> though in its owne eſſence it was ſupernaturall.</p>
               <p>Now by theſe two diſtinctions of things <hi>naturall,</hi> wee may euidently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre what is ſupernaturall, namely that which is aboue both theſe kindes of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, or diſtinctions of naturall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects; that is, which neither floweth from the principles of nature, neither is any way due vnto nature: as originall iuſtice was due vnto vs in <hi>Adam</hi> before our fall and corruption of nature.</p>
               <p>This diſtinction preſuppoſed, the difficultie conſiſteth in this, whether the vertue of the tree of life for to preſerue man from corruption, may bee called naturall, or rather is to bee deemed ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall?</p>

                  <hi>that name before, but afterwards of the euent: ſo that when God commanded our fore-fathers, that they ſhould not eate of that tree, either he called it by ſome other name, or he demonſtrated it vnto them, as it were with his finger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many other reaſons do the <hi>Rabbins</hi> giue, of the name of this tree, but ſo farre from reaſon, that they be not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the repeating, I will onely touch one as moſt fabulous, by which we may coniecture of the reſt. They ſay that our firſt Parents were created as infants in ſenſe, and reaſon, though men in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſtrength, and ſtature. Now becauſe this tree had a virtue of ripening mans iudgment, witt, and diſcretion of good from euill; it was therefore called the tree of knowledge, of good and euill: becauſe, to know good and euill, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Hebrue and ſcripture phraſe is as much as to haue the vſe of reaſon.</p>
               <p>But this is not onely contrary to the text, but alſo to reaſon: for certaine it is, that as man was created perfect in all the parts of his body; ſo was hee no leſſe in the powers of his ſoule. Yea
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17022:48"/> how is it likely that he was without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who was created lord of all vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures? who gaue them their names proper to their natures, and was to gouerne all things according to their nature, by his owne rule of reaſon: yea with whom God the author of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and chiefe rule of reaſon, had made this couenant moſt conformable to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: that if he liued according to the law of nature, and inſtinct of reaſon, his reward ſhould be aboue all nature, and exceed the capacitie of humane reaſon: wherefore who was both culpable in this pact, and puniſhable for his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, muſt in all reaſon, haue then had the vſe of reaſon.</p>

                  <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in his firſt booke of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities, perceiuing well the abſurditie of this opinion, fell into another, which <hi>Lyra</hi> deemeth not much leſſe abſurd: to wit, that this tree was therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the tree of knowledge of good and euill, becauſe it had virtue to ſharpen the wit, ripen the iudgment, and to giue prudence, and vnderſtanding to all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affaires.</p>

                  <hi>Lyra</hi> his refutation is this, becauſe the fruit of that tree being corporall, how could it (ſaith he) haue any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall effect? wherefore the minde, witt, and iudgment of man being ſpirituall, how could they be holpen by any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall cauſe? For though the ſuperior cauſe, and more perfect then his effect may haue influence into the inferiour and imperfect, yet neuer the inferiour into the ſuperiour. Therefore though the ſpirituall cauſes be of ſuch excellent perfection, that they haue influence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our bodies: yet neuer any corporall creature (ſaith he) is ſo perfect, that it can inflow in the ſpirituall. For what is that which any corporall thing may produce in the ſpirit? not any thing corporall, ſeeing that all, that is in the ſpirit, is ſpirituall: neither againe can it be ſpirituall, becauſe nothing ſpirituall can bee contained in the vertue of a materiall or corporall cauſe.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denied, but that this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>Lyra</hi> might haue ſome force in thoſe cauſes, which (as the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſpeake) doe worke <hi>directè &amp; per

               <p>NOw all things being created, and this inferiour world perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed, there wanted only one, who ſhould be gouernour and lord ouer all other creatures,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.26. 5.1. 9.6. 1. Cor. 11.7. Eph. 4.14. Col. 3.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Faciamus</hi> therefore ſaith God <hi>hominem ad imaginem &amp; ſimilitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem noſtram,</hi> 1. cap. Gen. 26. <hi>let vs make man in our image, after our likenes, and let him haue dominion ouer the fiſh of the ſea, and ouer the fowle of the aire, and ouer the cattell, and ouer all the earth, and ouer euery creeping thing, that creepeth vpon the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But peraduenture ſome may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund why man was created laſt of all creatures? ſeeing that hee being the moſt perfect and modell of the reſt, hee ſhould conſequently haue beene crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as prototypon and firſt type of the reſt, and therefore as he was the firſt in perfection, he ſhould alſo haue beene
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17022:51"/> firſt in his being and production.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that euen for the very ſame reaſon, he was created laſt, becauſe in a certaine manner hee was the end and perfection of the reſt: and thus beſide other interpretations, this alſo may be admitted of the philoſophicall axiome, <hi>quod est primum in intentione, est vltimu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in executione: that which is first or chei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the intention, is laſt in the execution, or production.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, man being to be lord of all the maine Machina of this world, it belonged vnto the diuine prouidence, firſt to prouide the habitation, and then to create him that was to inhabite.</p>
               <p>Or thirdly, becauſe man had neede of all theſe things, either for his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall ſuſtenance, or for his ſpirituall exerciſe.</p>
               <p>Or fourthly, becauſe it was conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, firſt to create the great world, containing euery thing in his due and diſtinct order; then afterwards to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate, perfect, and as it were to crowne the end of all his workes, with one, who was to be the crowne, end,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17022:52"/> and perfection of all corporall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yea containing in a more perfect manner and degree, the perfection of all, whatſoeuer he had created before.</p>
               <p>Finally, hauing created both corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and ſpirituall things each ſeparate, and diſtinct in their proper natures, it remained only to conioyne them both in one: inſomuch that, as in all things, whatſoeuer is compoſed of matter &amp; forme, the parts haue their being, <hi>prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate naturae,</hi> by prioritie of nature (as the Philoſophers ſay) before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning of both together, becauſe the parts are for the whole, and not the whole ordained for the parts. In like manner it was no leſſe conuenient, that man being compoſed of both corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ſpirituall ſubſtance, hee ſhould alſo be created after them both, as who was to be the ſecondarie end of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inferiour creatures.</p>

                  <p>Of the manner of the creation of Man.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE manner of mans creation is deſcribed vnto vs in the aforeſaid words. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Let vs make man in our image, after our likenes.</hi> Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it remaineth we explicate, what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine deliberation is this, what image is this, and in what likenes, and ſimilitude of God, was man created. And firſt of the firſt.</p>
               <p>This word <hi>faciamus, let vs make,</hi> may be taken in three ſenſes, or ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for firſt, it may ſignifie, how the eternall wiſdome of God, proceeding with a certaine deliberation and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell with himſelfe, the moſt holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, did goe about ſuch an excellent worke, as was the creation of man: to the end, that by that manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, hee might manifeſt the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of man, aboue all theſe inferiour
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17022:53"/> creatures, partaker of reaſon, beautified with prudence, perfect in wiſdome, and created to his owne image, and likenes.</p>
               <p>Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God is ſaid to vſe this manner of deliberation in the creation of man, to manifeſt the weight of the buſineſſe, and worth of the worke which hee then intended; to ſhew (I ſay) what a worke it was to create man, with ſo great ſanctitie, grace, and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to conſerue him in the ſame, and being loſt to reſtore him againe. For God in his eternall wiſdome, foreſeeing the frailtie of man, did likewiſe foreſee the act of his fall, and finally that hee would periſh, he did likewiſe know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the difficultie in conſeruing, and reſtoring of man after his fall; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally how to bring him to the end, for which he was created before his fall.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, if all theſe difficulties be duely conſidered in humane reaſon, it might iuſtly be doubted, according to our capacitie, whether it were conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to create man, or no? wherefore the Scripture accommodating it ſelfe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17022:53"/> to humane ſenſe and capacitie, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe vnto vs God the Father, as it were conſulting with the Sonne and the holy Ghoſt, of the creation of man. Then how it was concluded in that diuine Conſiſtorie, how it was moſt conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to create ſuch a creature, without which all the reſt had beene imperfect, and as a body without a head, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth without a ruler, or king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome without a King, confuſed, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, without order or beautie. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that to bring man to this finall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and end, many things were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, each perſon of the bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie did aſſume to himſelfe diuers fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; the Father to create, becauſe power and might doth eſpecially ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the Father; the Sonne did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the reparation of man after his fall (a worke of infinite wiſdome) and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is particularly aſcribed to this perſon, and infinite wiſdome: finally, the holy Ghoſt did particularly worke mans ſanctification, this therefore is likewiſe accommodated to this perſon, together with all ſpirituall graces and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17022:54"/> finall glorification. Neuertheleſſe theſe offices, operations, and workes, are ſo attributed to the three holy perſons, not that any one of them was effected alone by any one perſon, for whatſoeuer is wrought out of the ſacred Trinitie, in or by any creature whatſoeuer, is equally effected and wrought by all and euery perſon of the bleſſed Trinitie, but becauſe ſomething doth appeare in euery of theſe workes, which doth eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially manifeſt the Father, the Sonne, or the holy Ghoſt, the Fathers power, the Sonnes wiſdome, the grace and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the holy Ghoſt, therefore theſe and other the like attributes are particularly applied and attributed to each perſon of the bleſſed Trinitie.</p>

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:17022:54"/> and meaſuring the amplitude of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, he ſate him downe, and as it were taking his breath, hee called to minde that there was one thing as yet wanting, which was no leſſe neceſſary then fitting to be made; then ſaid he, let vs make man to our owne image and likeneſſe. Thus doeſt thou then thinke that a ſmall matter, which was intended by theſe words? A great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie without doubt it was, in that counſell of wiſdome, in that counſell of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt. Canſt thou iudge that there was any thing wanting, any thing ſuperfluous, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther done or to be done in vs, or about vs, in that ſacred Senate? There doubtleſſe was all our cauſe conſidered, there our fall foreſeene, there our death and perdition foreknowne, and determined vpon, to wit, that euery perſon ſhould vndertake ſome part of the worke, that as it is ſaid before, the Father ſhould create, the Sonne ſhould redeeme, and finally the holy Ghoſt ſhould worke the remiſsion of ſinnes, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what ſhould bee the reaſon why God deliberating about the creation of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17022:55"/> man, ſhould ſay, <hi>Faciamus, let vs make?</hi> To whom did hee ſpeake, ſpeaking in the plurall, <hi>let vs make?</hi> Shall we ſay to the earth, as to a compart of man? or to the Angels, as the fellow-workers with God, as though God had need ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the cooperation of the Angels, or were ſo ſenſeleſſe, as thus to conferre with that his creature void of all reaſon and ſenſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his ſeuenth chapter of the ſixt booke of the <hi>Exameron,</hi> anſwereth, that God ſpake not to himſelfe, becauſe hee ſpeaketh not in the ſingular, but in the plurall, <hi>let vs make,</hi> neither yet to the Angels, as who are but his ſeruants; therefore though the Iewes and Arrians doe neuer ſo much repugne, theſe words without all queſtion are ſpoken to his Sonne, as who is the true and liuely ſimilitude and likeneſſe of God the Father. And this I deeme to be the trueſt opinion, ſeeing that the eternall Sonne of God, euen as hee is the Word and Sonne of God, is a liuely and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe ſimilitude and likeneſſe, not only of his eternall Father, but alſo a moſt

               <p>Others not improbably doe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, that God therefore ſpake in the plurall, <hi>Faciamus, let vs make,</hi> as Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and great perſons are wont to doe, to ſhew their authoritie and maieſtie, ſaying, <hi>We will, We command, We decree,</hi> &amp;c. yet of the two I deeme the firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to bee beſt, and that the text may admit them both.</p>

               <p>Now therefore, when God ſaid that man was made to his image and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it was to giue vs to vnderſtand, that ſuch was the likeneſſe, and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the repreſentation, as could be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene an inferiour creature and his Creator: but becauſe God is of infinite perfection, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that his ſimilitude ſhould bee infinitely inferiour and of leſſe perfection then the prototypon or firſt type of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.

                  <hi>Rupertus</hi> in his ſecond booke of the Trinitie, and ſecond chapter, diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth very acutely of this point, of the difference betweene the image and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, vnto which man was created, giuing alſo the reaſon why the word <hi>image</hi> is prefixed before the word <hi>ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:</hi> in a word, his reſolution is this, <hi>that the Sonne of God is ſignified by the word image, and the holy Ghoſt by the word ſimilitude: for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene ſimilitude and image is this, that the image is in regard of one only, but a ſimilitude is at leaſt of two: now the eternall Sonne of the eternall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the image of God, according to that of the Apoſtle,</hi> 1. <hi>Coloſſ. who is the image of the inuiſible God. The Sonne (I ſay) is the image of the inuiſible God, equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible. For the vnderſtanding of which, we muſt preſuppoſe that there bee many kindes of images, as the image of man, of a horſe, a picture in the wall, an image gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in ſtone or wood, yea wee ſee euen the images of the Sunne and Moone in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet wee may not thinke that the Sonne of God is ſo to be called the image of God,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:17022:59"/> but rather, as the Apoſtle writeth in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>the figure of his ſubſtance; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as euery ſubſtance is knowne by his figure or ſhape, ſo God the Father by his word. Againe, the image of man is ſaid to be a propertie of his ſubſtance, in which ſenſe the ſacred text ſaith, that Adam be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat his ſonne to his image and likeneſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and called his name Seth. Hence wee may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how the eternall Sonne is the image of his eternall Father, and the holy Ghoſt the ſimilitude and likeneſſe of the Father and Sonne, ſeeing the goodneſſe and loue of the Father and Sonne is common to both Father, and Sonne. Hence it is, that it could not rightly be ſaid in regard of the Sonne only, let vs make man to our image and likeneſſe; for as the Sonne is Sonne in regard only of the Father, not of the Father and the holy Ghoſt iointly, ſo alſo is hee not the image of the Father and of the holy Ghoſt iointly, but of the Father onely. But it is rightly ſaid in regard of the holy Ghoſt, to our image and likeneſſe, becauſe as the holy Ghoſt is the infinite goodneſſe of the Father and Sonne, ſo is he likewiſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſimilitude and likeneſſe common to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:17022:59"/> both Father and Sonne.</hi> But this not by the force of his particular proceeding, as is the Sonne.</p>
               <p>Others are of opinion, that this word <hi>ad imaginem, to our image,</hi> doth ſignifie vnto vs the ſecond perſon of the bleſſed Trinitie, as he was to be incarnate, or to take our nature vpon him.</p>
               <p>But if we marke the phraſe of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred text, we ſhall eaſily finde that the Sonne of God was incarnate rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſimilitude of man, then that man was created according to his ſimilitude, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eugubinus</hi> in his <hi>Coſmopoeia,</hi> and <hi>Ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter</hi> vpon the firſt of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that God therefore ſaid, <hi>let vs make man to our image and likeneſſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when hee created man, hee tooke vpon him the ſhape and forme of man, to the end that he might the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe with man.</p>
               <p>But this ſeemeth rather to bee an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of their owne, then grounded in Scripture, becauſe it is moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (that which the Schoolemen doe commonly hold with <hi>Dionyſius</hi>) that all
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:17022:60"/> thoſe apparitions, which we reade in the old Teſtament, were not immediately of God, or by God himſelfe, but by the mediation of Angels, who taking vpon them airie or other apparant bodies, appeared vnto men in the ſhape and forme of men; but ſo neuertheleſſe, that they ſo appearing and ſpeaking, did alwayes repreſent the maieſtie of their maker, repeating for the moſt part Gods owne words, which hee had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately infuſed into their vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>Againe, if the aforeſaid opinion of the aſſuming of our humane nature is to bee vnderſtood by a perſonall vnion betweene God and man, then queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe God hath beene twice incarnate, and twice vnited to our humane nature, which is contrary to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Or if there was no reall vnion, or aſſumption of our humane nature, but only a ſhade or ſimilitude of the ſame, as wee reade that Angels haue often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times aſſumed humane bodies, how then was it truly ſaid, <hi>let vs make man to our image and likeneſſe,</hi> ſeeing that ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:17022:60"/> of humane nature could not in any wiſe be the image of God? neither could it be truly ſaid, that <hi>Adam</hi> was made to the image of God, if ſo be that we vnderſtand by the image of God not any true humane nature, but the ſhade only and ſimilitude of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Hence I conclude the firſt opinion to be the beſt, as which is moſt groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the ſacred text, and moſt follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the holy Fathers and other expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitours.</p>

                  <p>Whether the woman be made to the image of God, or no.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT might ſeeme raſhneſſe to doubt of this, if <hi>S. Paul</hi> did not giue vs ſome ground, denying (as ſome thinke) that woman was made to the image and likeneſſe of God, auerring her onely to be the image of man, in that he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:17022:61"/> woman, as the glory of man, to man as the image and glory of God. His words be theſe:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. &amp; 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Man ought not to couer his head, foraſmuch as hee is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man; for the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man.</hi> The woman therefore is not the image and glory of God, but immediately only the glory of the man, otherwiſe there could be no difference in this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the man and the woman, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the inference which <hi>S. Paul</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the precedent verſe.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, euen the text it ſelfe doth clearly confute this opinion: for after that it had beene ſaid, <hi>let vs make man to our owne image and likeneſſe,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently it is added, <hi>hee made them, both man and woman.</hi> Wherefore as man was made to the image of God, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was the woman made to the ſame.</p>

                  </note>
                  <hi>S. Auſtine</hi> is very large in giuing the reaſon of this concluſion; but briefly this is the anſwer: If wee conſider the principall reaſon, why man is ſaid to be the image of God, to wit, as hee is an
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:17022:61"/> intellectuall creature, and as he is indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the properties therevnto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed; ſo is it euident, that this word <hi>image</hi> doth equally ſignifie, and may be equally attributed both to man, and woman: ſeeing that they both parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of reaſon, and vnderſtanding, both bee indued with an immortall ſoule, both partakers of free will, both capable of ſupernaturall gifts, both of grace and glory.</p>
               <p>But againe, if this word <hi>image</hi> be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a more large, and improper ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification (as hath beene already expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated) we may well ſay, that man was made to the image of God, &amp; woman framed to the image of man. Becauſe, as God is the end to whom man is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly referred: ſo likewiſe man in ſome ſort is in regard of the woman, becauſe man is the head of the woman, by whom ſhee ought to be directed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. This explication ſeemeth to be grounded in the afore-ſaid place of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. to the <hi>Corin.</hi> 11. <hi>chap.</hi> for when hee had ſaid, <hi>that man was the image of God, and woman the glory of the man,</hi> he
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:17022:62"/> preſently giueth the reaſon. ver. 8. <hi>For man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not of the woman, but the woman of the man.</hi> ver. 9. <hi>for the man was not created for the womans ſake, but the woman for the mans ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, if the ſimilitude of God in man and woman be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, not according to their naturall gifts, but to the ſupernaturall of grace and glory, then queſtionleſſe it hapneth often-times, that ſome women are more adorned with theſe ſupernaturall graces, and gifts, and conſequently are more like vnto God then many men. As wee piouſly beleeue of the bleſſed Virgin, who as ſhee was pronounced by the Angell of God to bee bleſſed amongſt all women, ſo no doubt, but ſhee hath receiued an eternall bleſſing aboue all Angells and men, our Sauiour only excepted both God and man.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether man be made to the image of God euen according to his body and corporall proportion, ſhape, and lineaments; or doth in any wiſe repreſent the diuine maieſtie.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE ſubiect of this queſtion is ſo certaine of it ſelfe, and without all coutrouerſie, that for the reſolution thereof, wee haue more neede of the ſubtlety of diſtinction, then of any profound diuinitie, or learning. For ſeeing that the diuine maieſty is a moſt pure ſpirit, as infinite in eſſence, as in all and euery of his diuine attributes infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, how is it poſſible that there ſhould be any compariſon, ſimilitude, or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes with him, in that, which is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corporall, limited, and moſt baſe, ſuch as is our humane natute according to the body.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe ſeeing the body doth in ſome ſort repreſent the ſoule, like as
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:17022:63"/> the ſoule alſo is the image of God; hence peraduenture it may be inferred, that the body may in ſome ſort be ſaid to be a repreſentation or ſimilitude of God; in as much as the body (if wee conſider it in his full perfection) is an immediate glaſſe, ſimilitude, or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the ſoule, the which moſt perfectly repreſenteth Almighty God. Wherefore though in regard of our corporall ſubſtance, conſidered imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly in it ſelfe, without any relation vnto the ſoule, wee be no better then bruite beaſts: yet if we conſider it, in regard of our ſoule, and as it is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle of the moſt excellent image of God, it may after a remote manner, and mediately be ſaid to repreſent euen God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> propounding this queſtion,<note place="margin">Auguſt. lib. <hi>6.</hi> de Gen. ad literam cap. <hi>12.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>in what doth a man exceede the brute beaſts, ſeeing they are both made of earth? he anſwereth, in nothing, but becauſe he is made to the image of God, not in body, or corporall ſubſtance, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his ſoule, and ſpirituall powers.</hi> Though true it is alſo, that he hath euen
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:17022:63"/> in his body, a certaine property, which doth in ſome ſort demonſtrate the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude of his ſoule; as that he is made vpright, to the end, that hee might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how hee ought not to abaſe himſelfe to the terrene, vile, and baſe traſh of the world, like vnto the bruite beaſts, and other moſt baſe creatures, who as they are framed prone, and haue their bodies inclined towards the earth, can neuer erect themſelues to any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, or heauenly thing.</p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Bernard</hi> well noteth, that God made man vpright in ſtature, and ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted towards heauen, to the end that his corporall rectitude and vprightnes of his ſhape, might ſtirre him vp to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the ſpirituall rectitude, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of the inward man, who was made to the image of God; and that the beauty of our corporall ſubſtance, and outward proportion, and right diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the lineaments of our body might correct the inward deformitie of our ſoules, and the powers thereof. For what can be more vgly, deformed, and abominable in the eye of that all-ſeeing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:17022:64"/> God, then a ſinfull, and defiled ſoule in a beautifull body? Is it not a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and deteſtable thing, that an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and corrupt veſſell, ſuch as the body is, ſhould contemplate the heauens, view the Planets, and be delighted with the aſpect of the incorruptible ſpheares, and motions of the ſtarres; and that on the contrary ſide, the ſpirituall and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall creature, far more perfect, then all the celeſtiall globes, and heauens, the ſoule (I meane) of man, ſhould alwaies haue her eyes, that is hir inward powers, and affections debaſed, and caſt downe to the terrene traſh, and baſeſt creatures of this world.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Why God made man to his image, and ſimilitude.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MAny and moſt excellent reaſons may be giuen of this, but which I muſt needs confeſſe, are rather morall congruencies, grounded in the infinite goodneſſe of God, then in any other forcible convincing reaſon, plainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of the ſacred Text.</p>
               <p>The firſt whereof may be this, that God therefore made man like vnto himſelfe, that thence it might be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt how much the infinite goodneſſe of God exceedeth the malignitie, enuy, and malice of man: for God being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in his goodneſſe, yea in all other his attributes infinite; yet doth he not diſdaine our of his infinite goodneſſe, that, that, which in vs is limited and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſhould be compared and likened to that, which in him is infinite, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all compariſon: he enuieth not
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:17022:66"/> the perfection of our nature, he maketh it more perfect by grace, and by a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred league, and vnion, he combineth both, that by both we may be like vnto him in both, who is the author of both.</p>
               <p>And this with ſuch a degree of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated perfection, that man doth not only become like vnto God, but alſo may bee called, and is truly the adopted Sonne of God. So that all men may now participate of the grace, which one onely poſſeſſed by nature: inſomuch that as he being the naturall Sonne of God, is a perfect patterne of his eternall Father by nature, ſo wee alſo be a participated likenes, and ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude in ſome degree by nature, but moſt perfectly by grace.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon may be this (if ſo be that we may compare theſe infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour things of this world to thoſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, and infinite of God) like as a temporall Prince (hauing for to ſhew his power, magnificence, and maieſtie) built, furniſhed, beautified, adorned, and deck'd ſome excellent Citty, in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:17022:66"/> which hee himſelfe doth meane to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, doth there erect, in ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall part thereof his owne image, or ſtatue, in ſome precious porphire, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or other more excellent matter: euen ſo Almighty God, hauing out of his infinite wiſdome made this maine Machina, and beautifull Citty of the world, for the manifeſtation of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to the end that it might be knowne, and acknowledged, who was the only author and architect of all, hee was pleaſed to place in the midſt thereof, in the garden of paradiſe his owne i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and ſimilitude, man (I meane) who by his ſoule, and the three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall powers thereof ſhould repreſent the vnitie and trinitie of his maker: yea and by his outward ſhape and forme in ſome ſort likewiſe repreſent the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and conſequently, though not immediately, euen God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Inſomuch that, as it is ſaid of the portrature of <hi>Venus</hi> painted by <hi>Apelles,</hi> that none could perfect it, but onely <hi>Apelles</hi> who firſt began it: ſo likewiſe was it not poſſible that any ſhould
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:17022:67"/> bring our ſoule to her firſt perfection, but only God, who was her firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Hence it is that like as he, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faceth the image or ſtatua of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prince, is iuſtly condemned of high treaſon; ſo, <hi>a fortiori,</hi> who depraueth his owne nature, and by offending his maker depriueth it of grace, (the which is the ſeale, ſigne, and ſimilitude of the diuine power, nature, and maieſtie) is worthily condemned of high treaſon againſt the ſame power, and maieſtie. The third motiue, why God created man to his image and ſimilitude, may be this, to the end that all corporall things might be ſubiect, and each after their manner ſeruiceable to man, as who of all other creatures, was the expreſſe ſimilitude of their lord and maker, vnto which it ſeemeth that God did allude, when he ſaid vnto Noe, <hi>the feare of you and the dread of you ſhall be ouer euery beaſt of the earth,</hi>

               </p>

               <p>So that as it is ſaid of <hi>Cain,</hi> Gen. 4. verſ. 15. <hi>the Lord ſet a marke vpon Cain, leſt any man finding him ſhould kill him,</hi> ſo of the contrary ſide, it pleaſed our Creator, to impreſſe his ſimilitude, and likenes, not only in our firſt father, but alſo in euery man, leſt any man finding any other man, in whatſoeuer offence, not hauing the anthority, more then of man, ſhould lay his hands vpon any other man. Not (I ſay) hauing the authoritie more then of man, ſuch as I deeme to be in lawfull Magiſtrates,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:17022:68"/> and ſuch as are deputed by them for the execution of iuſtice. Becauſe this is not onely by the inſtinct of nature, but alſo proceedeth from the author of nature, and is laſtly confirmed by the giuer of grace. Inſomuch that hee himſelfe doth ſay to all his lawfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of iuſtice, and gouernours as well ſpirituall, as temporall, Luk. 10. ver. 16. <hi>who heareth you, heareth me, who deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me.</hi> Becauſe as it is one and the ſame law, ſo likewiſe the contempt of the law is one, and the ſame; and conſequently the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment anſwerable therevnto muſt bee one, and the ſame: But this not onely as the law is onely from man, but as it participateth of the law of God, man being the immediate law-giuer, Gods law, and eternall wiſdome being the firſt fountaine and rule, from whence all humane lawes are not only deriued, but alſo firmely eſtabliſhed, and to bee conformed: for otherwiſe they be no lawes, but tyranies or depriuation of lawes, but as they be conformable to that diuine, and eternall law.</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:17022:68"/>
               <p>The fourth reaſon, or motiue that moued God Almighty to make man to his image, was, becauſe he hauing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all theſe inferiour creatures, and ſubiected them to the rule, vſe, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of man, as to the moſt noble creature: ſo alſo he was pleaſed to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine him to a moſt noble end, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying of his Maker, that ſo man might be a meane to reduce other inferiour creatures, to their Creator, and end.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to the end that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vnion of man with his Maker, might appeare more manifeſtly, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in him, his diuine image, with ſo liuely and firmely an impreſſed ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, and character, that while man ſhould remaine in his owne being, ſo long likewiſe, ſhould he remaine, the type and image of the diuine nature and being. As it is ſaid of the famous <hi>Phydias,</hi> that he did, with ſuch rare Arte and cunning, ingraue his owne image in <hi>Mineruaes</hi> ſhield, that while the ſhield remained intire, his image likewiſe muſt remaine intire and vndefaced.</p>
               <p>Another reaſon of the impreſſion of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:17022:69"/> this moſt excellent &amp; beautifull image of God, in man, may bee, that man ſhould be incited and moued thereby, to the knowledge, and loue of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Wherefore as by the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other more imperfect creatures, he is brought in ſome ſort to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God; ſo with much more perfection by the knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Hence it is, that to the end, that he might be inexcuſable, and not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, in the curious ſearching of God in externall things, it pleaſed his Creator, to imprint in his ſoule, a moſt beautifull image, and cleare ſimilitude of the diuine nature and being, the which ſhould be a more perfect repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation vnto him, of the diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, then he ſhould finde in all other inferiour creatures. Man therefore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting vpon himſelfe, and viewing his owne nature, may aſcend vnto God, and perfectly view the diuine nature: Seeing the image, hee may alſo the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totypon: ſeeing himſelfe, hee may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend by contemplation vnto God: for ſeeing his owne ſoule, he ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:17022:69"/> it as the image of God; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer perfection or ſhade of perfection he findeth in himſelfe, that doubtleſſe hee ought and may conceiue to bee in God, though in a more infinite degree of perfection. The ſoule vnderſtandeth, God infinitely more; the ſoule freely diſpoſeth, willeth, and determineth, much more God: the ſoule is capable of the diuine vertue, wiſedome and grace, God is euen vertue, wiſdome and grace it ſelfe, yea that infinite ocean of graces and gifts, from whence all other graces and gifts doe proceed: according to that of <hi>Iames</hi> chap. 1. verſ. 17. <hi>Euery good giuing and euery perfect gift is from aboue, deſcending from the Father of lights.</hi>

                  <p>Whether the dominion ouer all other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creatures was giuen vnto man, and what manner of power that was.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS nothing doth more declare the loue of God towards man in this
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:17022:70"/> life, then that hee made him Lord and ruler ouer all his creatures: ſo nothing doth more declare the excellencie of mans nature, eſpecially in the eſtate of his innocencie, then that he had power and dominion ouer all creatures, the which as they were made for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, ſo were they alwayes ready at his becke in due obedience. No Lion ſo terrible, no Elephant ſo mighty, no Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſo fierce, no Fowle ſo rauening, no Whale ſo monſtrous, no not any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo indomite, but that it was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto mans dominion, while man was ſubiect to his, Lord and Maker. So God commanded, nature obeyed, (though now in ſome ſort that be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to nature) yea, all creatures did concurre vnto this ſubiection, while man was ſubiect vnto his Creator, who <hi>cloathed him</hi> (as the Preacher ſpeaketh) <hi>with ſtrength, and made him according to his owne image:</hi> yea made all fleſh to feare him, ſo that hee had dominion ouer the beaſts and fowles. Or as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">Pſal 8. v. 5. 6. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>he made him a little lower then himſelfe, crowned him with
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:17022:70"/> glory, and made him to haue dominion ouer the workes of his hands: and finally put all things vnder mans feet: all ſheepe and oxen, yea and the beaſts of the field, the fowles of the aire, the fiſh of the ſea, and ouer all things which paſſe thorow the paths of the ſeas.</hi> And hence it was, that <hi>Adam</hi> as Lord of all gaue names vnto all creatures, and <hi>Eue</hi> though by nature timorous and fearfull, was not in any wiſe daunted at the preſence and ſpeech of the Serpent.</p>
               <p>So that as we partly finde as yet by experience, and was much more in that happy ſtate of Paradiſe, all creatures ſhould haue beene ſubiect to man, while man was not diſobedient to God: yea as all inferiour creatures are ſubiect to their ſuperiour, according to their nature, order, perfection, and Gods decree, the imperfect to the more perfect, the matter for the formes, the corporall for the ſpirituall, the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents for the ſubſtances, the elements for the mixts, yea euen the heauens, ſtarres, and planets for man, man only for God, as ſubiect only to God, while
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:17022:71"/> he did not infringe this ſacred order and chaine, where by him all things were to be reduced and linked to God.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, this power and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of man ouer all other liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, proceeding from the excellencie of his nature, did remaine in him euen after his ſinne, though not in the ſame act, or actuall exerciſe of his power and dominion. For albeit whatſoeuer was due vnto nature, was blemiſhed, defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and corrupted by ſinne; yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſubſtantially belonging vnto na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or neceſſarily conſequent vnto the ſame, was wholly taken away. Wherefore this diuine image of God being engrauen in mans nature, mans nature remaining after ſinne, the ſame image of God muſt needs remaine, at leaſt way as much as was due vnto na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or not aboue the ſpheare of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and conſequently the aforeſaid dominion muſt alſo continue, as hauing his beginning from this image: it muſt (I ſay) continue (as the Philoſopher ſpeaketh) <hi>non actu, ſed potentia,</hi> not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes according to the exerciſe of the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17022:71"/> act in all particulars, but according to the extent of the power in generall, as may be manifeſtly proued out of the 9. of <hi>Geneſis:</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether in the ſtate of innocencie one man ſhould haue beene ſubiect to another, or rather all of equall dominion, power, and authoritie.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SAint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> anſwereth, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God had made man a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature,<note place="margin">Aug. lib. de Ciu. c. <hi>15.</hi>
                  </note> he would not haue him to domineere, but only ouer the vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:17022:72"/> So that man ſhould not haue had power ouer man, but onely ouer beaſts, &amp; other vnreaſonable creatures. Hence it was, that our firſt Fathers and Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs of the world were rather keepers of ſheepe, and feeders of oxen, then gouernours of men; that thence wee might vnderſtand, both what the right order of creatures did require, and what followed the diſorder of man, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of ſinne: ſeeing baſe bondage, vile ſlauerie, and ignominious ſubiection proceedeth of ſinne, as rooted in ſinne not ſpringing from nature. Wherefore before the iuſt <hi>Noah</hi> reuenged the ſinne, of his ſonne, wee neuer reade in the Scripture the names of bondage, ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or ſlauiſh ſubiection, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt neceſſarily bee rather the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of ſinne then the effect of nature. Yea this may be confirmed, in that God giuing power vnto man ouer all inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our creatures, he maketh no mention of the power of man ouer man, becauſe all men were equally made to the image of God, as likewiſe becauſe in that eſtate all were equally to be borne both in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:17022:72"/> perfection of nature, and adorned with grace, and conſequently all were to bee equall in power and dominion, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to the perfection of nature and height of grace, ſeeing this is equally grounded in nature, and with no leſſe equalitie was to be confirmed by grace.</p>
               <p>Now as it cannot be denied, but that this opinion of <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> hath ſome probable reaſons; yet I deeme the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to be much more probable: to wit, that though there ſhould haue beene no ſuch dominion in Paradiſe, as which ſhould then haue beene burdenſome vnto nature, and is now neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing our lapſe and fall: yet queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe there ſhould haue beene a kinde of order, ſubiection and ſubordination, of children, inferiours, and ſubiects, to their parents, ſuperiours, and politicall gouernours: not by way of an imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous command and abſolute authoritie, but by a voluntary and ſweet ſubiection flowing from nature, and confirmed by grace.</p>
               <p>My reaſon is this, for as all ſhould not haue beene equall in the gifts of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17022:73"/> wiſdome, knowledge, skill, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitie, and prudence; neither could they haue beene all equally apt for poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall gouernment: ſuch as I ſuppoſe ſhould haue beene in that moſt perfect place of Paradiſe, though in moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect manner. Neither may it be thought contrary to the happineſſe of that eſtate of Paradiſe, that man ſhould haue ſome kinde of ſubiection or ſubordination to man, ſeeing wee muſt neceſſarily admit the like in the bleſſed ſpirits and holy Angels: who as they are diſtinct in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, indiuiduall, and ſpecificall perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; ſo are they no leſſe in their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, offices, and degrees. So <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith, <hi>if there bee principalities, powers and vertues, it is neceſſary that they haue ſome ſubiect vnto them; who fearing and ſeruing them, are confirmed with their vertue and valour: which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of offices are not onely in this wicked world, but alſo are to bee in the world to come. A fortiori</hi> then, there might haue been the like ſubordination and order of gouernment amongſt men euen in the ſtate of innocencie.</p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:17022:73"/>
               <p>So that as wee finde in <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Daniel 8. Zachar. 2</note> that one Angell doth command another, notwithſtanding the perfect bleſſedneſſe of both: ſo likewiſe it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth moſt certaine, that there might haue beene the like ſubordination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, the like command and power ouer others, though wee had all remained in that pleaſant place of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. The wife ſhould haue beene ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to her husband, the children to their parents, the youth to their elders, and finally all inferiours to their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours.</p>
               <p>But how then (may ſome ſay) was the ſubiection of the wife vnto her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band inflicted as a puniſhment due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her ſinne, according vnto the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of God,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 4. verſ. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>thy deſire ſhall bee ſubiect to thy husband, and he ſhall rule ouer thee?</hi> How could this be inflicted for ſinne, if ſo be it was conſequent to nature?</p>
               <p>I anſwer briefly, that there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſubiection of the wife to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; the one voluntary, the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary; the one of nature, the other of ſinne; the one burdenſome, the other
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:17022:74"/> gratefull; the one confirmed by grace, the other repugnant to nature: finally the one nothing repugnant to the ſtate of innocencie, the other inflicted for originall ſinne.</p>
               <p>For certainly, though <hi>Eue</hi> had not fallen, and tranſgreſſed the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God by taſting the forbidden fruit; yet becauſe ſhee was the weaker veſſell, therefore euen her owne nature would haue required ſubiection vnto her husband; ſubiection (I meane) vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, not conſtrained; naturall, not forced; yea free, and without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, which now euen the beſt of <hi>Eues</hi> deſcendents doe ſometimes expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment in regard of their husbands, ſo that though the one ſubiection bee a propertie of nature, yet the other is a puniſhment of ſinne, ſignified by theſe words, <hi>and he ſhall rule ouer thee.</hi>

               <p>THis doubt may be vnderſtood of the ſeuerall parts of man, the body or the ſoule: firſt therefore as touching the ſoule, which as it was altogether of nothing, ſo it was not poſſible that it ſhould be brought out of that nothing, but by the immediate power and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular concourſe of the Almighty: for as <hi>S.

               <p>Wherefore the doubt onely is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Angels did in ſome ſort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to the creation of the body of man, ſeeing that (as <hi>S.

               <p>Neuertheleſſe, though I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but that the Angels might in ſome ſort concurre vnto the diſpoſition of the materiall ſubſtance of man, and thereby inſtrumentally to the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the forme; yet they may not in any wiſe bee ſaid to haue created either matter or forme, ſeeing both were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from Almighty God, as which were both produced of nothing.</p>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:17022:77"/> 
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>that the Lord God made man of the duſt of the earth, and breathed in his face the breath of life, and the man was a liuing ſoule.</hi> Wherefore man (as theſe Doctors ſay) was firſt made according to his materiall part, afterward this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was diſpoſed by God by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperating of conuenient qualities; and laſtly, after all this, was the ſoule infuſed, and vnited to the body thus diſpoſed.</p>

Thirdly, in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall propenſion vnto eternitie, and immortalitie,<note place="margin">Plato in Alcib. &amp; in Phaedone.

               <p>Yea the immortalitie of the ſoule is euidently proued, in that as <hi>Moyſes</hi> ſaith, God conſtituted man ſupreme Lord ouer all inferiour creatures, yea in that he breathed into him a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoule with full liberty ouer all his naturall actions, according vnto that of the fourth of Geneſis, the 7. verſe, where GOD ſaith thus vnto <hi>Cain,</hi> that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſhall be ſubiect vnto him, and hee ſhall rule ouer it, but more particularly this is demonſtrated out of the third of Exodus; where God ſaith vnto Moiſes, <hi>that he is the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Iacob, and

               <p>Finally, this may be deduced out of Deuteron: 4, where it is ſaid, <hi>that God made the Sunne, the Moone, the ſtarres, and the planets for the ſeruice of man,</hi> as for a more perfect creature, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently participating a more perfect immortalitie, then is the incorruption of thoſe eternall globes, and ſtarres.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AS touching the firſt point, that he was not created in Paradiſe, it is
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:17022:79"/> manifeſt, that though the woman was created in paradiſe, yet the man was not, for ſo it is ſaid of him.

               </p>
               <p>As touching the ſecond point, that <hi>God tooke man, and put him into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Eden.</hi> This may be vnderſtood three wayes; firſt by inward inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which God might ſhew him, that it was his pleaſure, that hee ſhould haue that for his habitation, in which ſenſe many vnderſtand that of Math. 4. <hi>that our Sauiour was caried of the ſpirit into the wildernes, to wit, by the inward inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> though he went alſo voluntarily of himſelfe.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:17022:80"/>
               <p>Secondly, we may vnderſtand it, that he was caried by the ſpirit of God, or rather conveighed by the immediate power of the Almighty, as we read of <hi>Henoch, Habacuck,</hi> and <hi>Philip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or laſtly, that he was tranſported by ſome Angell, in the ſhape and forme of man, who ſhewing him the way, did lead him into paradiſe, as wee read of the Angell <hi>Raphael,</hi> how he lead <hi>Tobias,</hi> and to this laſt I incline the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the opinion of <hi>S. Auſtine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now it may be demanded, why God would not create man in paradiſe? the reaſon may be, to the end that hee might more manifeſtly vnderſtand his goodnes, and liberality towards him, and that, that place was rather giuen vnto him of meere grace, then any wiſe due by nature.</p>
               <p>But why then (may ſome ſay) were the Angels created in heauen, yea all other liuing creatures created each in their owne place? I anſwer, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the puritie of the empyreall hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, did exceed the Angelicall puritie, neither the groſneſſe of this inferiour
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:17022:80"/> globe of the earth, did exceed the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of corporall creatures there liuing, and therefore theſe two places were moſt apt for the creation and habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Angels, and theſe inferiour crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But ſuch was the perfection of paradiſe, that it was in no wiſe to bee deemed a conuenient place for humane habitation, mans nature (I meane) only conſidered, not the grace, and bounty of God thereby manifeſted.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>MOyſes</hi> anſwereth, Gen: 2. ver: 15. <hi>that the Lord tooke the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, that he might dreſſe it, and keepe it;</hi> or as the vulgar hath, <hi>that he might worke in it,</hi> to giue vs to vnderſtand how much God abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth idleneſſe, ſeeing that euen in that place, where there was no neede of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:17022:81"/> God would not haue man idle: not an ill item for our lazie gallants, who thinke their gentilitie to conſiſt in idlenes, and a point of honour to liue of other mens labour: but euen in this (I am of opinion) that God doth pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh them, that they haue more griefes, and more diſcontent in their idle plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, then others in their moſt weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome toiles, and labours, which though it be a moſt voluntary bondage, yet is it likewiſe the moſt baſe, and cruell ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie to the baſe appetites; a tyranny of Satan, a double bondage to a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tyrant, to Satan, to ſinne; for as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith, who committeth ſinne, is the ſlaue to ſinne; ſo who ſubiecteth himſelfe to the ſuggeſtions of Satan is a ſlaue to Satan; an intolerable ſlauery, and an infinite miſery; the beginning miſerable, the proceedings damnable, the end, as which hath no end, into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable.</p>
               <p>Now therefore leſt <hi>Adam</hi> or his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie ſhould by alluring idlenes, come to this endles paine; God of his mercy placed <hi>Adam</hi> in paradiſe, <hi>vt operaretur,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:17022:81"/> &amp; cuſtodiret illum,</hi> that he might worke and keepe it, to wit, that hee working might keepe paradiſe, and paradiſe by the ſame worke might keepe him from idlenes, from ſinne: becauſe that is the ordinarie cauſe of ſinne, for as it is true, that which the Poët ſaith, that labour blunteth the arrowes of Cupid, ſo doth it no leſſe other darts of the deuill.</p>
               <p>But hence peraduenture ſome patron of idlenes may inferre, that labour was contrary to that bleſſed ſtate of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, as which required all quiet, reſt, and content; no, rather I ſay that it was conſequent, or neceſſarily pertaining to that bleſſed ſtate, ſeeing that labour was not any toile, or paine, but rather a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and a voluntary effect of his well diſpoſed minde, as it is now likewiſe to men not ſo ill affected, <hi>quorum otium,</hi> as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid, <hi>maximum negotium,</hi> ſo as <hi>S.

               <argument>
                  <p>Why God commanded Adam that he ſhould not eate of the tree of knowledge of good and euill.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>TErtullian,</hi> in the beginning of his booke againſt the Iewes, ſaith, that this commandement was giuen to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> as the firſt principall foundation and ground from whence all other lawes were deriued, and in which all the ten Commandments be virtually included: ſo that as <hi>Adam</hi> was the firſt beginning of mankinde, ſo this was the firſt ground of all other lawes. But though this cannot be reiected, as an improbable ſpeculation, yet certainely it is not ſo firmely grounded in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred text, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> imagined.</p>
               <p>The reaſons therefore in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on why God ſo ſtrictly prohibited the eating of the aforeſaid fruit, was, firſt, that thereby, as God had declared vnto vs, his power ouer vs: ſo wee ſhould
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:17022:83"/> ſhew our obedience towards him: not that (as <hi>S. Auſtine</hi> noteth) God hath neede of our ſeruice;<note place="margin">Auguſtin. l. <hi>8.</hi> de Gen. ad literam cap. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> but that wee haue neede of his power, protection, rule, and dominion ouer vs; according to that of the Pſalmiſt, who ſpeaking in the perſon of God, ſaith, <hi>conſtitue ſuper eos legiſlatorem, vt ſciant gentes quoniam homines ſunt, Conſtitute a ruler ouer them,</hi> (as the vulgare tranſlateth) <hi>that the heathen may know that they are but men:</hi> ſo that as it is a token of vaſſalage, and ſubiection to receiue lawes, ſo is it of power, dominion, and authority to command, conſtitute, ordaine, and ſet downe lawes to bee obſerued. Yea ſecondly, God gaue this law vnto man, that thereby he might exerciſe his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience towards God, a vertue as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to man, as acceptable in the ſight of God,<note place="margin">Aug. lib. <hi>8.</hi> de Gen ad litera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cap. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> and therefore (as <hi>S. Auſtine</hi> well noteth) God gaue not this law in any obiect of it ſelfe otherwiſe euill, or of its owne nature good: to the end that the vertue of his obedience might be the more illuſtrious; becauſe it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riueth not his excellencie, from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:17022:84"/> obiect, but from the formall, the ſole ſubiection to Almighty God.</p>
               <p>It may ſeeme peraduenture not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable to ſome, that the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which God had infuſed into the nature of man, might haue ſufficed to lay open, try, and manifeſt mans obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience towards God: to what end then ſhould the ſecond law of abſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the tree of the knowledge of good and euill be added, as a ſecond tryall of that which otherwiſe might ſufficiently bee manifeſt by the law of nature, and obedience therevnto? I anſwer, that the law of nature would not haue beene a ſufficient tryall of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> obedience: becauſe it is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether manifeſt by the law of nature, that God is ſole and ſupreme Lord o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all mankinde: for ſome doe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the law of nature is a proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie onely due vnto a reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as euery ſpecies, or kinde of liuing creatures hath their particular proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie agreeing to their nature.</p>
               <p>Againe ſome are of opinion, that thoſe things which are contained in the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:17022:84"/> law of nature, are to be imbraced, or reiected in as much as they agree, or diſagree with naturall reaſon: not as they are commanded, or forbidden by God, as ſupernaturall agent. So that although it be preſcribed by God vnto all men, yet doth it not ſufficiently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his moſt ample &amp; abſolute power ouer all mankinde: ſeeing that by this law there is not any thing commanded, or forbidden, but onely that which is according to humane reaſon, either good, or euill, of its owne nature.</p>
               <p>Wherefore Gods abſolute domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and extent of his diuine power, were not ſufficiently knowne onely by this law of nature, but onely as it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the inſtinct of nature: the which as it was but onely in things within the ſpheare of nature, could not poſſible ſhew the extent of the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power of God in things both with in the compaſſe of nature, and aboue nature.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Why God commanded Adam that he ſhould not touch the tree of knowledge of good and euill, eſpecially ſeeing he fore-knew his fall.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe anſwer is eaſie, to wit, that by the tryall of his obedience, in this one commandment, hee might ſubiect the whole man vnto himſelfe in all things, and that man by the breach, or keeping of the ſaid commandement, might know by wofull experience (as he truely did in his wofull fall) the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, betweene good and euill; ſo that whereas before hee knew it onely by contemplation, now he ſhould find it by a lamentable experience: yea, in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:17022:85"/> this, his ſinne was the greater, in that the obiect of his obedience was ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile, and the commandement ſo eaſie to be kept.<note place="margin">Aug. li. <hi>14.</hi> de ciu. Dei, cap. <hi>15.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>For</hi> (as <hi>S. Auſtine</hi> ſaith) <hi>like as the obedience of Abraham is highly extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, becauſe the ſlaying of his ſonne with his owne hands was of ſuch difficultie; euen ſo the diſobedience of Adam in Paradiſe was the more hainous, by how much the precept which he had impoſed was the more facile to haue beene fulfilled. Againe, as the obedience of the ſecond Adam was ſo much the more admirable, becauſe hee was obedient euen vnto death; ſo the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of the firſt Adam was the more deteſtable, by which he became diſobedient euen vnto death: for where the puniſhment of the diſobedience is great, and the thing commanded eaſie, who can expreſſe how great an euill it is, not to obey, and how great an iniurie to ſo great a power, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially threatning ſo great puniſhments?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as touching the ſecond point, I anſwer, that therefore God as abſolute in his will, ſcience, and power, would create <hi>Adam,</hi> and giue him the aforeſaid precept, which hee knew neuertheleſſe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:17022:86"/> hee would ſo preſently violate; to the end that his vnhappy fall might bee an occaſion of our moſt happy Redeemer: for as the Schooles commonly hold, if <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, the Sonne of God had not beene incarnated: ſo that (as <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith) in regard of this it was a happy fall, which deſerued, or rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to haue ſuch a Redeemer: <hi>O foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix culpa, quae talem ac tantum habere me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruit Redemptorem:</hi> in which I know not whether I ſhould more admire the goodneſſe of God in the creation and reſtauration of man, or the ingratitude of man towards God, in and after both his creation, redemption, and infinite offences and falles; but that as it is the nature of that infinite goodneſſe to effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuate the greateſt good, of the greateſt euill, ſo is it no leſſe conſequent to mans naturall propenſion, and of himſelfe, as it were an infinite of euill, of the greateſt good to worke the greateſt euill: a thing not eaſily beleeued, if our daily and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full experience did not ſo manifeſtly proue it: for as God by our greateſt and originall euill, did worke our greateſt
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:17022:86"/> and originall good, and this onely out of his infinite goodneſſe (the incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I meane of his eternall Sonne) ſo man out of his infinite malice, did by occaſion of this ſo infinite a benefit, worke the moſt wicked outrage that could bee imagined, againſt his benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour, by ſeeking his diſhonour and death, who ſo abaſed himſelfe, to giue him life: ſo that I know not whether I ſhould more admire God ſhedding his bloud for man, or man ſpilling the bloud of God; mans ingratitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, or Gods infinite bountie towards man.</p>
               <p>And hence it is, that as faith teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs, this euill and ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> was foreſeene and permitted of God, ſo is it no leſſe a blaſphemous hereſie, to auerre, that this or any other ſinne is wrought by God, wrought I meane by his particular command or concourſe; not by his vniuerſall, which is due vnto all entitie and being, yet in ſome ſenſe neither due vnto this of ſinne, as which in it ſelfe hath neither entitie nor being: but rather (if wee ſpeake formally) is a

               <argument>
                  <p>What death that was which God threatned to inflict vpon Adam for his tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS it is certaine that the mortalitie of <hi>Adam,</hi> and conſequently of all mankinde, did proceed of ſinne; ſo it hath no ſmall difficultie to declare what inſtant death that was, which God ſo inſtantly threatned ſhould follow mans ſinne, for ſo ſaith the text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. the 17. verſe: <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt die the death.</hi> What day is this? what death is this? ſeeing that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther firſt ſinned the laſt day of his life, nor yet died the firſt day of his ſinne: true it is, that as death was due at his laſt day, for his firſt ſinne, ſo was it not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted in the firſt houre, for his firſt dayes ſinne. Was this death peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:17022:87"/> the priuation of grace, by which his ſoule ſupernaturally liued? for as the body liueth by the ſoule, ſo <hi>Adams</hi> ſoule liued by grace, conſequently as the body is ſaid to die by the abſence of the ſoule, ſo the ſoule ſpiritually by the priuation of grace: but yet though this be true, yet it cannot bee the ſole meaning of the aforeſaid words; ſo that then no other death ſhould haue beene due vnto man, but only the death of the ſoule, the ſeparation from God, who as he had ſinned both in body and ſoule, was iuſtly to be puniſhed in body and ſoule; which the effect afterward ſhewed, that God had before accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly decreed: ſo that the ſentence of his death, as it was executed both in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule, ſo it is to bee vnderſtood to haue beene decreed as well in regard of the body, as of the ſoule; becauſe the corporall death is a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of the ſpirituall; now then the ſpirituall being inflicted in the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of mans ſinne, how chanced it that the corporall alſo did not befall him in the day of his ſinne? eſpecially
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:17022:88"/> ſeeing that though God threatned not death in the inſtant of his ſinne, for the inſtant of his ſinne, yet at leaſt God ſaith, <hi>that man ſhall die in the day of his ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it peraduenture threatned, and not truly decreed? or if really decreed, how is it not abſolutely performed? God threatned his death in the day of his eating; <hi>Adam</hi> eateth, and yet liueth long after his eating. Could <hi>Adam</hi> change the decree of God, or could God decree that hee meant not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme? Hee performed not, therefore he decreed not; if he decreed not, how then was it ſaid, <hi>In the day that thou ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thou ſhalt die the death;</hi> not of the ſoule only, for that was inſtantly, but of the body principally, ſeeing that is ſaid to be <hi>in tempore, in the day,</hi> not <hi>in inſtanti,</hi> or momentarily. Was it a threat only, as wee reade of the <hi>Niniuites?</hi> but they changed their minde, they repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their ſinne; therfore as the ſentence was conditionall, the condition being changed, the ſentence of God (though eternall) is ſaid to be reuoked, not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:17022:88"/> in act, but immuted in obiect, the act being immutable, the obiect muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, according to the decree of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable act. But here in this of <hi>Adam,</hi> the cauſe is altered; God threatneth, the ſinne is committed, why then is not the ſentence preſently executed? <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thou ſhalt die the death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iuſtinus</hi> the Martyr,<note place="margin">Iuſtinus in dialogo cum Triphone Iren. lib. <hi>5.</hi> aduerſus haereticos.</note> in this more acute then Catholike, anſwereth, that euen the very ſame day that <hi>Adam</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of the ſpirituall life of his ſoule, he was no leſſe alſo of the other of his body: for though he died not the ſame day, according to the naturall reuoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heauen, yet ſeeing that a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeeres (as <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeake) are but as one day in regard of Gods eternitie, <hi>Adams</hi> death being within the compaſſe of the thouſand yeeres, may well be ſaid according to Gods and the Scriptures phraſe, to haue died euen the ſame day that he was created.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing true hiſtories doe ſeldome admit any ſuch ſubtilities, I rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to the interpretation of <hi>Ierome</hi> and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:17022:89"/> 
                  <hi>S. Auſtine,</hi> who vnderſtand that ſentence of death, not of death then inſtantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, but of the neceſſitie of death then forthwith contracted. <hi>Ierome</hi> therefore commendeth <hi>Symmacus,</hi> who for that which our tranſlation hath, <hi>morieris, thou ſhalt die,</hi> tranſlateth <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talis eris, thou ſhalt become mortall:</hi> ſo that whereas hee had beene created to an eternitie of life, now he is made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the penaltie of death; or as our interpretation ſeemeth to inſinuate, euen to death it ſelfe, ſeeing that euen from thenceforth hee began to be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, who by grace before was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther immortall. So that, as according to true Philoſophie, wee may ſay, that the alteration of qualities, or the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions vnto generation, are in ſome ſort generation; ſo likewiſe by this phraſe of Scripture, <hi>that Adam ſhould die in the day of his ſinne,</hi> we may well vnderſtand that he began to die, <hi>diſpoſitiuè,</hi> by way of diſpoſition, in the day of his ſinne, ſeeing ſinne was the immediate diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or cauſe of his mortalitie and death, ſinne (I ſay) being the cauſe of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:17022:89"/> his mortalitie, his mortalitie conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently prepared forthwith the way vnto death. For ſo it is ſaid in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke of the Kings; <hi>We all die, and ſlide away as water:</hi> for though at the preſent, while we liue, we be not iointly dead, yet becauſe wee ſlide away to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards death, as the flouds towards the Ocean, wee are all ſaid to die inſtantly, becauſe our life, euen from the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant thereof, is nothing elſe but a ſwift ſliding towards death: yea our tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life (as <hi>Gregory</hi> the great well no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) compared to the eternall, is rather to be called a preſent death, then a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued life; ſeeing that our continuall corruption and declining towards death, may rather be tearmed a long or continuall death, then euen a very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie life.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the creation of the woman, and to what end ſhe was created.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS it is moſt certaine that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal end of the creation of <hi>Adam</hi> was to ſerue, loue, honour and obey his Lord and maker; ſo the ſame likewiſe was the womans principal end. Againe, as <hi>Adams</hi> ſecondary end was to bee the father of mankinde, ſo was it alſo <hi>Eues</hi> to be the mother of all, and to bee a comfort and helpe vnto her husband, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. verſ. 18. <hi>It is not good that man ſhould be alone; I will make him an helper meet for him:</hi> good neither in regard of God, of man, nor of the world; of God for his ſeruice, of man for his helpe, of the world for procreation: for though this was not abſolutely neceſſary, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in regard of God, man, or the world; yet ſuppoſing the decree of God, that hee would be preſerued by the beautifull diſpoſition and order of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:17022:90"/> this world, it was not only moſt conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, but in ſome ſort neceſſary, that he ſhould <hi>make man a helper,</hi> and a hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>meet for him:</hi> for though hee could otherwiſe haue diſpoſed of things by immediate creation, yet was it more agreeable to the nature of things, and for the ſweeter diſpoſition of the courſe of nature, that mankinde ſhould rather be multiplied by naturall courſe of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, then by ſupernaturall power and immediate creation.</p>
               <p>Hence peraduenture it may be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that ſeeing God ſaith, <hi>it is not good that the man ſhould be himſelfe alone,</hi> that conſequently it muſt be euill if hee bee alone; and therefore as by this ſentence lawfull matrimonie is confirmed, ſo vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie by the contrary conſequence is condemned: for whatſoeuer is oppoſite to that which is good, muſt neceſſarily bee condemned as bad, as which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the priuation of good.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, (as our Sauiour did to the Sadduces, in their obiection tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching mariage) <hi>Matth.</hi> the 22.29. verſe, <hi>Yee are deceiued, not knowing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:17022:91"/> for as Chriſt is not againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> neither the new Teſtament contrary to the old, neither the greater perfection to the leſſe; ſo neither is virginitie contrary to matrimonie; both are laudable, both in their degree excellent, but virginitie more laudable, more excellent, moſt admirable, as by which wee rather imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the angelicall ſtate and perfection, then follow our owne depraued nature and corruption. This is the definition of <hi>Paul,</hi> not any humane inuention; for thus doth <hi>Paul</hi> determine this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, the 1. to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ch. 7. verſ. 25. <hi>Now concerning virgins I haue no command of the Lord; but I giue mine aduice, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithfull.</hi> Loe here, virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is not commanded, but commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; not exacted by force, but commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded through grace; neither counſelled to all, becauſe it cannot be performed of all; counſelled therefore onely to ſome, and thoſe but few, ſeeing few can attaine to this perfection.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. c 7. verſ. 27.</note>My counſell therefore is that of Saint <hi>Paul, Art thou bound vnto a wife? ſeeke
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:17022:91"/> not to be looſed,</hi> leſt looſing the knot, which God hath knit, thou looſe thy ſelfe. <hi>Art thou looſed from a wife? ſeeke not a wife:</hi> here <hi>Paul</hi> counſelleth, hee commandeth not, neither is his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell extended to all, ſeeing all cannot be capable of this counſell; not onely by nature, becauſe this is not any gift of nature, but alſo euen by a leſſer meaſure of grace: for though the Sunne of iuſtice doth ſhine ouer the iuſt and vniuſt, and ſend downe the dew of his grace vnto all, yet not with equalitie vnto all, but according vnto his good pleaſure and will.</p>
               <p>Wherefore as <hi>S. Paul</hi> proſecuteth, <hi>If thou takeſt a wife, thou ſinneſt not; and if a Virgin marie, ſhe ſinneth not:</hi> verſe 37. <hi>He that ſtandeth firme in his heart, that he hath not neede, but hath power ouer his owne will, and hath ſo decreed in his heart, that he will keepe his virgin, he doth well: ſo then hee that giueth her to mariage doth well, but he that giueth her not to mariage doth better: the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liueth; but if her husband be dead, ſhe is at libertie to marie
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:17022:92"/> with whom ſhe will, only in the Lord: but ſhe is more bleſſed if ſhe abide, in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and I thinke that I haue alſo the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is this the minde onely of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> but euen of his maſter our Lord and Sauiour: <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. <hi>Some there bee, which haue made themſelues Eunuches for the kingdome of heauen:</hi> not that this is contrary to the firſt inſtitution of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie, but only a greater perfection, ſuppoſing a ſufficient or ſuperabundant multiplication of mankinde; ſo that (as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith) the firſt decree of God was concerning generation, the ſecond perſwaded continencie; when the world was as yet void and rude, wee multiplied by generation; now that the world is filled, and fully repleniſhed, thoſe that can containe, <hi>ſpadonum more viuentes, caſtrantur ad regnum,</hi> by puritie of life doe dedicate themſelues to the kingdome of heauen.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the time and place of <hi>Eues</hi> creation, and firſt as concerning the time, it is euident out of the ſacred text, that <hi>Adam</hi> was firſt created. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:17022:92"/> in the firſt of <hi>Timothie,</hi> chap. 2. ſaith, that <hi>Adam was firſt created, and then Eue.</hi> Furthermore, it is euidently deduced out of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he ſaith,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> that <hi>after Adam was created, all the liuing creatures were brought before him, among all which no helpe meet for him being found, the Lord God cauſed an heauie ſleepe to fall vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the man, and he ſlept, and he tooke one of his ribs, and cloſed vp the fleſh in ſtead thereof, and the rib which the Lord God had taken from the man, made he a woman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is euident, that there was ſome time betweene the creation of the man, and the womans production: but it is not ſo eaſie to determine, how much that was, though certaine it bee, that this time did not exceed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the firſt ſix dayes: <hi>for in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth day God ended his worke which hee made, and the ſeuenth day he reſted from all his worke which he had made.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the creation of <hi>Eue</hi> could not bee the ſeuenth, as <hi>Catharinus</hi> and others preſume to auerre.</p>
               <p>As concerning the place, where <hi>Eue</hi> was created, though <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:17022:93"/> doe thinke, that ſhee was created out of Paradiſe: neuertheleſſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſeemeth more agreeable to the written word: for there it is euident, that after <hi>Adam</hi> was brought into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, all liuing creatures were ſet before him: where God ſeeing the neceſſitie of the womans creation, to wit, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam might haue an helpe meete for him,</hi> he framed her out of the ſide of <hi>Adam,</hi> for ſo ſaith the text, <hi>and the Lord God ſaid, it is not good for man to be alone, I will make him an helpe meete for him.

                  <p>Why Eue was created out of the ribbe of Adam ſleeping, and how that could be without any griefe vnto Adam, and finally why the woman was not created immediatly of the earth as well as man.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe maſter of the ſentences, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other ſchoole Diuines ſay, that <hi>Eue</hi> was framed out of the ſide of <hi>Adam</hi> ſleeping, for to ſignifie the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall production of the Church, out of the ſacred ſide of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but with this difference of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, that the firſt ſleepe was ioyfull
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:17022:94"/> to the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe hee had not tranſgreſſed as yet; the ſecond, moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominions and painefull vnto the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, becauſe he had taken vpon him the ſinnes of the firſt. The firſt was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of paine, by particular diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the author of nature; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was full of ignominie, and paine, by a ſupernaturall, and gracious diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of God, as author both of nature, and grace: to the end that nature being now depraued by ſinne, might be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againe, and reſtored to her former eſtate by an omnipotent grace.</p>
               <p>But now could this be, the <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould haue a ribbe taken from him without any griefe?</p>
               <p>For the vnderſtanding of this wee muſt neceſſarily praeſuppoſe that no griefe was agreeable to <hi>Adams</hi> eſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his fall. Now then I anſwer, that as God could, and <hi>de facto,</hi> did ſuſpend, or withdraw his concourſe, and action from the Babilonian fire, for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the three children, <hi>Sidrach, Miſach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego:</hi> ſo likewiſe here, for to ſhew the like power, did God
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:17022:95"/> withdraw his concurſe from all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall paſſion, which naturally ſhould haue followed the extracting of the ribbe.</p>
               <p>Now to the laſt, why the woman was not created immediatly of the earth, as well as the man, but of the mans ſide and ribbe? I anſwer, it was, to the end, that <hi>Adam</hi> acknowledging her to bee a part of his ſubſtance, and ſhee alſo knowing that ſhee proceeded thence, it might be an occaſion of a more perfect loue: for that otherwiſe, he conſidering how ſhee was the cauſe of his miſery, it might be an occaſion of a perpetuall, and implacable hatred betweene them: or principally this was to ſignifie the myſticall vnion betweene the ſecond Adam Chriſt, and his Church; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of Paul,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.32.</note> 
                  <hi>this is a great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but I ſpeake concerning Chriſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Church,</hi> becauſe the diuine vnion betweene Chriſt, and his ſpouſe, was ſignified by the vnion of <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eue:</hi> ſo that as <hi>Eue</hi> was framed out of the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> ribbe, ſo was the Church out of the ſide of the ſecond.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Why, and how Eue was made of the ribbe of Adam.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT was not without the particular prouidence of the wiſdome of God, that the woman was not made neither of the moſt principall, nor of the moſt baſe parts of man: not of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, leſt ſhee ſhould be too impudent; neither of the baſer, leſt ſhee ſhould be too much debaſed; ſhee was therefore created of the ribbe, and of that ribbe, which was next to the heart; the one to ſignifie the mediocritie of her condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the other to inſinuate the eſteeme, and reſpect, which both ſhee ſhould haue towards <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> towards her; as alſo to ſignifie the heart, loue, and fidelitie, which he ſhould beare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, who had her being from ſo neere his heart.</p>
               <p>Now the difficultie is, how <hi>Eue</hi> being of ſo perfect ſtature, as ſhe was created,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:17022:96"/> could be created out of a ribbe of ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle quantitie, ſeeing either ſhee was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall in ſtature with the man, or not farre inferiour in greatnes vnto him, was there any matter added vnto the ribbe? or was the ſame matter of the ribbe multiplied? ſurely it might be, as <hi>Lombard,</hi> and <hi>Gabriel</hi> ſaid, by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of the ſame matter, or by rarefaction of the ſame ribbe; or rather, which I deeme more probable, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of new matter, as the Diuines hold it happened in the multiplication of the fiue barly loaues (of which wee read in the goſpell).</p>
               <p>Neither may it be inferred hence, that then it ſhould rather haue beene ſaid, that the woman was framed of other matter, then of the ribbe of <hi>Adam,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the more principall part beareth the name, not alwaies the greater; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when the principall part, is not only the principall, but alſo the firſt of the whole compound or worke.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, ſeeing the ribbe of <hi>Adam</hi> was the firſt, and principall matter, of which the woman was created, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:17022:96"/> the which the other was but an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it is therefore rightly, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſaid, that <hi>Eue</hi> was made of the ribbe of <hi>Adam,</hi> without the expreſſing of any other matter; becauſe, though the new aſſumed matter was the greater in quantitie, yet leſſe in perfection: ſo likewiſe in the muitiplication of the fiue loaues, though that which was added was much more, then the precedent quantitie of bread; yet becauſe it was but an addition vnto the former, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the name was deriued of the more principall part, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon axiome of the Philoſophers, <hi>deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatio ſequitur principaliorem partem,</hi> the name muſt follow the more princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall part.</p>

                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:17022:98"/> man according to his naturall conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and perfection hath 24 ribbes, twelue of each ſide; wherefore if our firſt father had thirteene on the leaft, it may bee thought that this was rather monſtrous, then agreeable to nature, which neither admitteth want, nor ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie; either therefore this ribbe was ſuper-abundant in him, and ſo he monſtrous by ſuper-abundance, or it is wanting in vs, and ſo we monſtrous by defect.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that though it were mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous in any of vs to haue 13 ribbes, yet was it in no wiſe in reſpect of <hi>Adam:</hi> it were in regard of vs, becauſe none is to be created of vs; but in regard of him the defect were rather monſtrous, becauſe <hi>Eue</hi> was to be created of it; ſo that neither was <hi>Adam</hi> a monſter, when he had that, which we haue not, neither yet deficient, when he wanted that of which <hi>Eue</hi> was created: becauſe the name of <hi>monſter</hi> is not ſo much in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of ſuperabundance or want, as in regard of the ends, and purpoſes inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the author of nature, grounded
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:17022:98"/> in that, which is moſt connaturall.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, though in regard of the particular nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> as hee was but one particular man, this ribbe was ſuperfluous, and ſo conſequently in an other perſon might be thought mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, yet in regard of him, of whom the reſt of mankinde was to proceed, it was moſt naturall.</p>
               <p>Neither doe theſe two ſorts of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations imply contradiction: ſeeing that euen in nature we haue infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this: for ſo the heauieſt droſſe, and maſſieſt matter, hath a naturall, and particular inclination to deſcend to the center, which neuertheleſſe will aſcend for the preſeruation of the courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: <hi>ne detur vacuum,</hi> when there is any danger of vacuitie of aire, or want of any other body, which naturally ſhould fill all places; ſo that, as to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend is proper to heauy things, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their particular inclination, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſo to aſcend is no leſſe agreeable vnto their nature conſidering their vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall propenſion for the preſeruation of the vniuerſall good of nature.</p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:17022:99"/>
               <p>In like manner if we conſider <hi>Adam,</hi> as one particular man, not as firſt parent of our humane nature, it were mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, that hee ſhould haue more ribbs on the leaft ſide, then on the right, or more then any of his poſteritie haue: but if we conſider him, as he was to be the firſt father of mankinde, after that particular manner that God hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, it was moſt neceſſarie, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his nature, that hee ſhould haue more ribbs then any other of the ſame ſpecificall nature, ſeeing, that our firſt mother <hi>Eue</hi> was to haue her being of this ribbe of his, and we all ours, by her.</p>

                  <p>How mankinde ſhould haue beene multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied if Adam had not ſinned.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>GRegory Niſene, Damaſcene, Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, Procopius Gazeus,</hi> and diuers others were of opinion, that if <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, there ſhould haue beene
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:17022:99"/> no ſuch naturall generation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, as is now, but rather an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate multiplication, and production of men by the immediate power of God. So that as we ſhall be like vnto the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in the coeleſtiall Paradiſe through our vnion vnto Chriſt; ſo wee ſhould not haue beene vnlike vnto them in the terreſtriall by the immediate producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God: wherefore as ſinne was the cauſe of our diſſimilitude from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall life, ſo was it (according to theſe Fathers) the cauſe alſo of the diſſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of our production; the Angells being by creation immediately from God, wee not immediately, but by mediate generation: and hence it is that <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaith, that conſanguinities, and affinities proceed of ſinne, not of nature.</p>
               <p>The ground peraduenture of theſe Doctors may be the impure, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt manner of our generation, and the deformitie of luſt together with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate pleaſure thereof proceeding, the which our firſt fathers (as <hi>S.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:17022:100"/> and thence were aſhamed and couered themſelues.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, I cannot but deeme it moſt certaine, but that ſo long, as mans ſuperiour powers were ſubiect to God, ſo long alſo ſhould mans inferiour powers haue beene obedient to man; wherefore whiles there was no defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie by ſin in the will, neither ſhould there haue beene any filthines or abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the actions of nature: But as our eyes, and other ſenſes be as yet ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to our will, ſo alſo, all other now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling inferiour powers, ſhould haue beene ſubiect to their ſuperiour: laſtly, as all deformities and diſorder ſhould haue beene taken away; ſo all confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and order ſhould haue beene left. The ſenſitiue appetite ſhould haue been ſubiect to the reaſonable, the reaſonable to the ſpirit, the ſpirit to God. And as no diſorder in nature could proceede from the author of nature; ſo no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in the acts of nature, could haue beene found in the courſe of nature; and this, though euen in the very eſtate of innocencie there had beene genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:17022:100"/> of mankinde, as now it is: as now (I meane) in the ſubſtance of the act, not in the manner of raigning, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging luſt.</p>
               <p>And this certainely was Gods intent in the creating of our firſt fathers male, and female; becauſe, if it had not been for generations ſake, they might haue beene both created males: becauſe all things at their firſt creation were created in their greateſt perfection: if therefore the man bee more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect then the woman, why ſhould they not both haue been created male, if it had not beene for their multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the ordinarie courſe of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially ſeeing God bleſſed them with theſe words, which ſignifie no leſſe; <hi>increaſe,</hi> or (as the Hebrue hath) <hi>fructifie, and multiply,</hi> eſpecially ſeeing (as the Philoſopher ſaith) <hi>generation is the moſt naturall action of life;</hi>

                  <p>Whether there ſhould haue beene more men, or women in the ſtate of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: or rather an equalitie of both ſexes: and how there could haue beene any women, ſeeing they are ſaid to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of the defect of nature.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS touching the firſt point, I thinke it moſt probable, that there ſhould haue beene more men, then women, if ſo be that wee had perſiſted in the ſtate of innocencie: my reaſon is, becauſe nature then being in a full perfection, would for the moſt part haue produced the moſt perfect, which queſtionleſſe is the male, for the moſt part I ſay, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, becauſe the female alſo was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the naturall propagation of mankinde.</p>
               <p>Againe it was neceſſarie for the moſt part, not altogether neceſſarie, but only moſt perfect, and therefore moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that moſt perfect eſtate.</p>

                  </note> yea as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith is <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter intentionem agentis,</hi> and therefore ſeemeth rather a monſtrous act of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, then a perfect iſſue, or patterne of the Parents, or nature.</p>
               <p>And leaſt this may ſeeme improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, euen nature herſelfe (as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher writeth) giueth ſufficient tokens and ſignes of this, ſeeing that the female ſex is begotten rather in tender and old age, then in the flouriſhing, and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous time of mans age: for as naturall heat hath not attained vnto his perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the one, ſo hath it loſt his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vigour in the other. It is alſo ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſeene that the moiſteſt, and moſt feeble bodies doe beget females, by
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:17022:102"/> reaſon of the want of naturall heate.</p>
               <p>Furthermore the ſame philoſopher ſaith, that the female kinde being of their owne nature feeble, and cold, are to be deemed as a defect, errour, default, or declination of nature.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe I anſwer briefely, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this matter more belongeth to Philoſophy then to Diuinitie) that the production of the female, doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede only, or rather not alwaies of the defect of nature; but oftentimes alſo of the more remiſſe manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe of the power of generation, as alſo of the imagination thereto incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and other like naturall defects: whence it is, that though the generation of the female be in vs a ſigne of leſſe vigor of nature; yet was it not ſo in <hi>Adam,</hi> but rather it proceeded of the afore-ſaid cauſes of the imaginatiue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, or particular diſpoſition of the author of nature, for the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of mankinde.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IT is the common opinion of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and other Diuines, that <hi>Adam</hi> had infuſed into his ſoule a moſt perfect knowledge of all naturall obiects, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Preacher, the 17. chapter, where thus hee deſcribeth the creation of man, together with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues wherewith he was firſt endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, verſ. 3.<note place="margin">Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus cap. 17. v. 3.4 5.6.7 8 9.10.11.</note> 
                  <hi>He endued them with ſtrength by themſelues, and made them according to his image, and put the feare of man vpon all fleſh, and gaue them dominion ouer beaſts and fowles. They receiued the vſe of the fiue operations of the Lord, and in the ſixt place he imparted them vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and in the ſeuenth ſpeech an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the cogitations thereof. Counſell, and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:17022:103"/> a tongue, and eyes, eares, and a heart gaue he them to vnderſtand Withall hee filled them with the knowledge of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and ſhewed them good and euill. Hee ſet his eye vpon their hearts, that he might ſhew them the greatneſſe of his workes. He gaue them to glory in his maruellous acts for euer, that they might declare his works with vnderſtanding. Beſides this, hee gaue them knowledge, and the law of life, for an heritage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hence it was that <hi>Adam</hi> perfectly vnderſtanding the nature of other infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour creatures, gaue each of them their names according to their natures; for ſo ſaith the text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.19. <hi>And out of the ground the Lord God formed euery beaſt of the field, and euery fowle of the aire, and brought them vnto Adam, to ſee what he would call them, and whatſoeuer Adam called euery liuing creature, that was the name thereof, and Adam gaue names to all cattle, and to the fowles of the aire, and to euery beaſt in the field.</hi> Now if <hi>Adam</hi> gaue to each liuing creature his name according to his nature, as queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe he did, it can be no leſſe certaine,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:17022:103"/> but that he had a perfect notice (if not comprehenſion) of their natures, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which hee had giuen them their names.</p>
               <p>But now the difficulitie is, how this is to bee vnderſtood, that God brought the beaſts and fowles vnto man; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only by an intellectuall repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, bringing them or repreſenting them as obiects of his minde and cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as <hi>Caietan</hi> holdeth or corporally, truly, and really, in their owne nature, eſſence and being: and if thus, by what meanes? whether by naturall inſtinct, guiding them to performe this will of the author of nature, or that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe immediately by himſelfe, or by the miniſterie of his Angels did preſent them before <hi>Adam?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though I finde no conſtant reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this point, either in the Scripture, Fathers, or reaſon; neuertheleſſe that which ſeemeth to me moſt probable, is, that as euery liuing creature hath his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, peculiar, and proper inſtinct vnto diuers things, according vnto the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of their natures, varietie of diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:17022:104"/> and qualities; ſo likewiſe I thinke it moſt certaine, that they had in regard or this, a particular inſtinct by the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary concourſe of God: to the end that as they were all to acknowledge, <hi>Adam</hi> for their Lord and maſter, hee might according to his abſolute power and dominion ouer them, giue them their names as a token both of their ſubiection, and of his abſolute power and dominion.</p>
               <p>And this may alſo bee the reaſon, why God preſenting all other creatures to the preſence of man, he did not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bring him the fiſhes as well as the beaſts of all ſpecies and kindes, becauſe the beaſts being domable, and eaſie to be tamed by man (at leaſtway whiles man was ſubiect to God) might ſerue for the vſe of man, while man was not diſobedient to God: or peraduenture this was, becauſe the fiſhes could not naturally liue out of the water, as man cannot in any wiſe perſiſt without God.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, as touching his knowledge and perfect comprehenſion of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of theſe inferiour creatures, I
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:17022:104"/> doubt not, but that I may bee bold to pronounce that of him, which was ſaid of <hi>Salomon</hi> in the booke of wiſdome, 7. chap. verſ. 15. to wit, <hi>that hee granted him to ſpeake as hee would, and to conceiue as was meet for the things that were giuen him: becauſe it is hee that leadeth vnto wiſdome, and directeth the wiſe. Hee gaue him certaine knowledge of the things that are, namely to know how the world was made, and the operation of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: the beginning, ending, and midſt of the times: the alterations of the turning of the Sunne, and the change of ſeaſons: the circuits of yeeres, and the poſitions of the ſtarres: the natures of liuing creatures, and the furies of wilde beaſts: the violence of windes, and the reaſonings of men: the diuerſities of plants, and the vertues of roots: and all ſuch things, as are either ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, or manifeſt them he knew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if this be indubitable in reſpect of <hi>Salomon,</hi> it ſeemeth much more in regard of <hi>Adam:</hi> wherefore doubtleſſe he was the wiſeſt of all men, our Sauiour only excepted, the author of his and of all other wiſdome.</p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:17022:105"/>
               <p>Neither doth my poſition in any wiſe contradict that which is ſaid vnto <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in the firſt booke of Kings, chap. 3. verſ. 12. <hi>Loe I haue giuen thee a wife and vnderſtanding heart, ſo that there hath beene none like thee before thee, neither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee ſhall ariſe the like vnto thee.</hi> For though the propoſition bee vniuerſall, yet ſuch like oftentimes are not to bee vnderſtood vniuerſally, as <hi>S. Hierome</hi> well noteth, exemplifying in that of the Pſalme,<note place="margin">Hieron in comment, in cap. primum ad Epheſios.</note> 
                  <hi>Euery man is a lier: againe if hee who ſpeaketh it, lieth, neither can it be true which he ſpeaketh, that euery man is a lier:</hi> wherefore if it bee a true ſaying, that <hi>all men are liers,</hi> wee muſt take this word <hi>all,</hi> not that abſolutely nd vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſally all be liers, but that a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are liers. So likewiſe although it bee ſaid that <hi>Salomon</hi> exceeded all men in wiſdome, yet this word <hi>all</hi> may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not abſolutely all, but with ſome exception. For ſo argueth the ſame Father in another place:<note place="margin">Hieron. in comment. in caput quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ad Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manos.</note> 
                  <hi>Scribit &amp; alibi Apoſtolus; The Apoſtle writeth alſo in another place, how wee taught all men, and warned euery man, not that he taught

               <p>Or peraduenture this vniuerſall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>that Salomon was the wiſeſt of all men,</hi> is to be vnderſtood in reſpect of thoſe, who had not their ſcience, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and knowledge infuſed: for who can thinke (who thinketh ſo diuinely, and iudgeth ſo ſupernaturally as hee ought of our Sauiour) that the wiſdome of <hi>Salomon</hi> was in any wiſe to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared euen with the accidentall wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome infuſed into the ſoule of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour?

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the knowledge which Adam had of the things aboue nature.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS it is moſt certaine that our firſt fathers were created perfect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to nature; ſo is it no leſſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of grace, and all other ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall acts and habits thereto annexed: wherefore as hee was endued with the perfection of all naturall knowledge, ſo was he no leſſe perfect in the ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall; not in ſo high a degree as the ſoule of our Sauiour, nor yet as the leaſt of the angelicall ſpirits, yet certainly more perfect then all other men, not only in regard of his faith, which was moſt perfect, but alſo in regard of other obiects more clearely reuealed.</p>
               <p>And firſt as touching faith, it cannot be denied, but that he had this ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall gift infuſed into his ſoule, becauſe this,<note place="margin">Ad Heb. c. 11 v. 1.</note> as <hi>S. Paul</hi> teſtifieth, <hi>is the ſubſtance or argument of things hoped for, the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:17022:106"/> ground, or confidence of things not ſeene.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, ſeeing he was created not ſo much for the obtaining of any naturall thing, as for the enioying of ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bleſſedneſſe; it muſt needs follow, that as his nature and naturall end did neceſſarily inferre and bring with it the knowledge of the naturall meanes, by which it was to be obtained: ſo likewiſe the decree of God, by which hee was predeſtinated vnto a ſupernaturall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and end, did neceſſarily inferre and bring with it by a connaturall conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the notice of the ſupernaturall meanes neceſſary for the obtaining of that end, obiect, and felicitie, which was aboue nature. Inſomuch that as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the matter and forme of things either corruptible or incorruptible, is in regard of the accidents: ſo likewiſe is Faith a neceſſary argument, of things not appearing; neceſſary (I ſay) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the inference, not euident in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the concluſion, or that which is inferred. For, though the obiects bee ſufficiently patent, and moſt cleere in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:17022:107"/> themſelues, and vnto thoſe bleſſed ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits who haue the eyes of their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding already illuminated with the light of glory: yet is it obſcure vnto vs, who as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, as yet ſee only in <hi>ſpeculo &amp; in aenigmate, in a glaſſe, and by ſpecies, obſcure enigmaes,</hi> and other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect repreſentations of inferior crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>Hence the difficulty is, what things in particular were reuealed to <hi>Adam?</hi> I anſwere, that as the obiects of this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall ſcience may bee reduced to foure kindes: ſo likewiſe the ſciences, and knowledge, may be ſayd to haue beene fourefold. The firſt, of his reward, for though the perfecteſt loue bee not mercenarie, and ſo baſe, that it doe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally reſpect the reward: yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, the all-ſeeing and infinite good God doth neuer leaue the leaſt loue of man without his reward. <hi>It is neceſſary</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) that hee who doth come vnto God, ſhould beleeue, and eſpecially beleeue that he is a rewarder.</hi> Wherefore as the firſt act of a regenerate perſon is faith, ſo the firſt obiect of this act is touching
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:17022:107"/> our end: for (as the Philoſopher ſaith) <hi>quod eſt primum in intentione, eſt vltimum in executione;</hi> that which is firſt in inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſpeculation, is laſt in practiſe or execution: and contrariwiſe, that which is firſt in practiſe and execution, is laſt in intention and ſpeculation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as our ſupernaturall end and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is the laſt thing which wee are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy; ſo is it the firſt and principall which we ought to ſeeke and intend: and if this bee true in all our actions, it muſt needs bee much more in this of faith, which is (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid) <hi>the ſubſtance, ground, or confidence of things hoped for,</hi> and of all our ſupernaturall actions.</p>
               <p>By this it is manifeſt, that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the knowledge of the meanes of this ſupernaturall felicitie, was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the perfection of the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and notice of this end, inſomuch that as this end may be attained vnto by a threefold meane, ſo was man ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereunto by the ſame meanes, to wit, faith, hope, and loue: faith for the diſcouerie of the obiect of our felicitie; hope, for the effectuating of the meanes
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:17022:108"/> of our happineſſe; loue, for the combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of both the meanes; a triple cord, with a triple knot, which not euen the power of Satan ſhall be able euer to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue.</p>
               <p>Againe, it ſeemeth moſt certaine, that he knew the fall of the damned ſpirits, becauſe he might by the knowledge of this be much holpen in the obtaining of his end; as thereby inferring the ſeueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the diuine iudgement towards the Angels, and his infinite mercy towards men, by the one he might be moued to feare the like ſeueritie, if himſelfe ſhould fall, and hope to repleniſh the places of the fallen Angels if he ſhould ſtand.</p>
               <p>The third obiect reuealed vnto <hi>Adam</hi> was the myſterie of the bleſſed Trinitie, how God (I meane) was three in one, and one in three; three in diſtinction of perſons, one in the indiuiſibilitie of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being, and eſſence, and all his other infinite attributes: the which though diſtinguiſhed for our capacitie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their obiects, yet he well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood them to bee one and the ſame in nature, realitie, and ſimplicitie of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:17022:108"/> My reaſon why I thinke the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation of this obiect vnto <hi>Adam</hi> to be certaine, is, ſeeing that the ſight of it is to be the perfection of our bleſſedneſſe in the life to come, it muſt needs be alſo a beginning of it here: wherefore as it is there by a perfect ſight face to face; ſo it muſt be likewiſe here <hi>in ſpeculo &amp; in aenigmate,</hi> with imperfection and obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Yea ſeeing <hi>Adam</hi> knew himſelfe to be made to the image of God, three in one, and one in three, in his ſimple eſſence, and his three ſpirituall powers: ſo he muſt needs inferre the ſame of his prototypon and Creator. Laſtly, hee had reuealed vnto him the incarnation of the Sonne of God, not as paſſible for his ſinne (which certainly hee did not foreſee) but as to bee vnited to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the excellencie of the myſterie, and becauſe he was to bee the head of mankinde.</p>

               <p>THough it be out of all controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that <hi>Adam</hi> was before his fall in the ſtate of grace; yet many bee of opinion, that hee was not created ſo: this was the opinion of <hi>Alex.

Now then as matrimoniall vnion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the conſent of both the parts; ſo likewiſe here, and the rather, that <hi>Adam</hi> thereby might the better know himſelfe, and the weakneſſe of his owne nature, by an after infuſion of grace.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe it ſeemeth much more
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:17022:109"/> probable, that though wee diſtinguiſh grace from originall iuſtice, or howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that <hi>Adam</hi> was created in grace; for (as <hi>S.

                  <p>Whether if Adam had not falne, all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie ſhould haue beene borne in the grace and fauour of God, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the ſame.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>HVgo de ſancto Victore</hi> anſwereth, that though <hi>Adam</hi> had begot chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in his innocencie, yet that his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould not haue beene borne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritors of their fathers righteouſneſſe, becauſe righteouſnes proceedeth not of fleſh and bloud, but of the meere grace of God: ſo though they had not beene borne in ſinne, yet neither ſhould they haue beene endued with originall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe the common tenent of Diuines doth perſwade the contrary: to wit, that as <hi>Adam</hi> by his ſinne did tranſfuſe into his poſteritie the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:17022:110"/> of ſinne together with the crime it ſelfe: ſo likewiſe if hee had kept the ſame originall iuſtice, in which hee was created, he ſhould alſo haue deriued the ſame vnto all his poſteritie. And this in effect is the meaning of the Arauficane Counſell, where it defineth <hi>Adamum peccando ſanctitatem &amp; iuſtitiam perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſe, non ſibi tantum, ſed omnibus etiam poſteris ſuis, that Adam loſt both his ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie, and righteouſnes, by his originall ſin and tranſgreſsion, not only in regard of him ſelfe, but alſo to all his poſteritie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither may it bee inferred hence, <hi>that then grace were no grace</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh) ſeeing that it ſhould be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall in the aforeſaid cauſe: for though in ſome ſenſe it ſhould haue been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, that is, hauing her being toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with nature; yet ſeeing it was not of nature, neither due vnto nature, it cannot be denied, but that it was grace, as which was not conſequent vnto na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but aboue all nature. Wherefore as now in the law of grace, all that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated by baptiſme in Chriſt, doe in and by baptiſme (according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

               <p>Wherefore like as Adam, though cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in grace, could fall from that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py eſtate of grace; ſo it ſeemeth moſt probable, that his poſteritie might alſo, ſeeing that wee read of no particular prouidence &amp; grace promiſed to them, which was not profferd to their firſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

For it is one thing not to be able to dye; another to be able not to dye: that belongeth only to the Angells, this is agreable euen vnto man; not by the conſtitution of his nature; but by the benefit of the tree of life; from which tree hee was baniſhed, as ſoone as hee ſinned, that hee might dye; who if he had not ſinned, might not haue died. wherefore he was mortall by the nature of his corruptible body: but yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall by the benefit of his Creator, for if the body was mortall becauſe it could dye, by the like reaſon it was
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:17022:112"/> immortall, becauſe it could not haue died: for, that is not immortall onely, which cannot dye at all, vnleſſe it be ſpirituall, which is promiſed to vs in our reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Now therefore the difficultie is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this gift of immortalitie due to the perfect ſtate of Paradiſe, was due alſo and connaturall vnto man perſiſting there.</p>
               <p>Many of the beſt learned of this age are of opinion, that this originall iuſtice, which did bring with it a power of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie, and a perfect ſubiection of the fleſh, and ſenſes vnto the rule of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, was a gift due euen vnto nature, granted vnto man, as not only agreable, but likewiſe belonging, and conſequent vnto his naturall integritie, and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: inſomuch, that mans nature being now depriued thereof, may iuſtly bee deemed in a manner maimed, imperfect, and monſtrous, eſpecially ſeeing it was to proceed of naturall cauſes, ſuch as was the eating of the tree of life.

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:17022:113"/> gouerne the whole man, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quently, that the fleſh, and ſenſes ſhould be ruled by reaſon, and obey the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour power: wherefore as it is without all queſtion, that the rebellion of the fleſh againſt reaſon is contrary to mans nature; ſo originall iuſtice, which did reſtraine the rebellion, did queſtionleſſe pertaine to the naturall ſtate, integritie and perfection of man; yea, how were it otherwiſe agreable to the diuine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to make a creature partly immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and incorruptible; partly againe mortall and corruptible.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe vnleſſe the queſtion be more <hi>de nomine,</hi> then <hi>dere,</hi> I deeme it moſt certaine, and out of all queſtion, that, that gift of immortalitie was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall, as which was in no wiſe due or conſequent to nature, for neither this immortalitie could proceed of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities proportionate to the body, ſeeing theſe tend rather to corruption, then immortalitie, as which are each contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to other, and after a ſort conſuming one another, and theſe tending to the diſvniting of the body and ſoule: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:17022:113"/> could this immortalitie be <hi>ab ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terno agente,</hi> from ſome outward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and cauſe; for then, if it were ſo, it were rather to bee deemed in ſome ſort oppoſite to the inclination of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the which of it ſelfe, as we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, tendeth to corruption; yet, as that which is <hi>congenitum,</hi> or produced ioyntly with nature, may in ſome ſort be ſaid to be naturall, or rather conna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, ſo I will not deny of this quality of immortalitie (though of it ſelfe it be altogether aboue nature) yet reſpectiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in regard of the firſt infuſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nature, I will not (I ſay) deny, but that it may be deemed naturall.</p>

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:17022:114"/> deuill in the ſhape and likenes of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and therefore he was curſed vnder the name of a ſerpent.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe this opinion ſeemeth not true, for if it had beene a deuill, then would he haue left the likenes of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent after the temptation: as when any Angell doth aſſume for any time a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſhape, preſently after hee hath performed his purpoſe, hee putteth of that corporall ſhape: but this ſerpent, euen after the temptation remained in his former ſhape, for after that <hi>Eue</hi> had beene ſo ſeuerely reprehended for eating the forbidden fruit, preſently ſhe excuſed her ſelfe, and ſaid, <hi>the ſerpent deceiued me, then the Lord God ſaid vnto the ſerpent, becauſe thou haſt done this, thou art curſed aboue all cattell, and aboue euery beaſt of the field, vpon thy belly ſhalt thou goe, and duſt ſhalt thou eat, all the dayes of thy life.</hi> So that the ſerpent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his former ſhape, euen after <hi>Eue</hi> had eaten of the forbidden fruit, neither could this curſe be fitly applied to a fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſerpent.</p>

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:17022:115"/> 
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> thinketh that here by this word ſerpent, is neither ſignified a true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, nor yet any thing that hath the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of a ſerpent, but onely the deuill in his owne likenes, who by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his ſubtiltie, and vehement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of mans deſtruction, is often in the ſcripture termed a ſerpent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith that this temptation was not externally, by propoſing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit in outward ſpeach, and perſwaſion, but by the inward ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, mouing, and inclining her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, as this opinion is moſt improbable, ſo is it contrary to the common opinion of the Fathers, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of the Scriptures, and common ſenſe of all Chriſtians; who generally hold, that <hi>Eue</hi> was tempted of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill in a corporall, and true ſerpent, who allured her by externall perſwaſion, and preſent view of the forbidden fruite.</p>

               <p>Now if it bee demanded how this ſtandeth with naturall reaſon, and the iuſtice of God, which is neuer contrary to reaſon, but is rather the rule of all reaſon, that the ſerpent being innocent, and not capable of reaſon, neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of ſinne, that hee ſhould haue inflicted ſo great a puniſhment and curſe, as is denounced againſt him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. verſ. 14. where God ſaid to the ſerpent, <hi>becauſe thou haſt done this, thou art curſed aboue all cattell, and aboue euery beaſt of the field; vpon thy belly ſhalt thou goe, and ſhalt eat duſt all the dayes of thy life:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer with <hi>Barcephas</hi> and others aboue alledged, that God did this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally as a puniſhment, and in hatred of the principall agent, the old ſerpent the deuill; thereby to puniſh him not only in himſelfe, but euen in his inſtrument,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:17022:121"/> by which hee had committed that hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous offence againſt his God: like as he who breaketh the inſtrument in hatred of the Muſitian who plaied vpon it. So likewiſe in the 20. chapter of <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> God commanded that the beaſt ſhall be ſtoned to death, with which any man hath offended; thereby to ſignifie how great the offence is in the ſight of God, who doth puniſh it, not onely in the principall actor thereof, but euen in his inſtrument; thereby to ſignifie vnto vs how hatefull ſinne is, ſeeing often hee doth puniſh it in his vnreaſonable and inſenſible creatures, who are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the ſinne it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Againe, he curſed the ſerpent for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans ſake, as he did the earth for <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne: yea and that which is moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, he drowned the world with an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall deluge, not ſparing the beaſts, for their owners ſinnes.</p>
               <p>The like alſo we finde in Princes and other Potentates of this world, who take vengeance of the innocent for the nocents ſake, of the ſonnes for their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers offences, of their ſubiects for their
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:17022:122"/> Princes outrages. So the Poet, not as a Poet ſaith:

               </p>
               <p>But now the difficultie may be about theſe words aboue alleaged: <hi>Vpon thy belly ſhalt thou goe, and ſhalt eat duſt all the dayes of thy life.</hi> For if it were a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent before, euen the very name doth ſignifie, that it crept vpon its belly: if then it was the ſerpents nature, how was it a curſe? or if a curſe, how was it his naturall propertie?</p>
               <p>I anſwer with <hi>Ephren</hi> and <hi>Barcephas</hi> in his booke of Paradiſe, that creeping rather proceeded of Gods curſe, then of the ſerpents nature, who as we reade of other ſerpents, went vpon his feet, yea more vpright then any other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:17022:122"/> but as <hi>Lucifer</hi> his principall mouer became by his ſinne a moſt vgly deuill of a moſt beautifull Angell; ſo the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, who was the inſtrument of <hi>Lucifer</hi> in this action, became a moſt filthy, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous, and deteſtable creeping beaſt or worme, of a beautifull and vpright going creature.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, as I haue already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſinuated, the curſe pronounced againſt the ſerpent, is principally to bee vnderſtood againſt the principall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the temptation, and mouer of the ſerpent, to wit, the deuill, according to the opinion of <hi>S. Auſtine, Beda, Ruper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Hugo de ſancto Victore, Caietan,</hi> and many others: ſo that the deuill (as hath beene touched already) is called a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, for his ſubtiltie and craft in decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of mankinde. Againe, he is ſaid to be curſed amongſt all the beaſts of the earth, becauſe he is condemned to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall puniſhment: and whatſoeuer is ſaid to be obſcene, filthy and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in any whatſoeuer beaſt, or other moſt filthy creature; that ſpiritually is found in the deuill in a higher degree,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:17022:123"/> and more deteſtable meaſure: <hi>hee goeth likewiſe vpon his breaſt and belly,</hi> becauſe he tempteth principally in pride and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie: and therefore moſt fit to tempt, attempt, and ouercome the woman, as moſt inclinable to theſe kinde of vices: he eſpecially (I ſay) tempteth <hi>in pride,</hi> ſignified by the breaſt; <hi>in luſt,</hi> by the belly. Or finally, hee goeth vpon his breaſt, which is the ſeat of the iraſcible power, anger, and wrath; and vpon his belly, becauſe this is the fountaine of all filthy luſt and concupiſcences.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>Originiſts</hi> doe vnderſtand this allegorically, ſo that by this kinde of cuſtodie is meant nothing elſe but
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:17022:125"/> the particular prouidence of God, by which our firſt parents were depriued of all hope of returning to Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>Others thinke that by the Cherubin and fiery ſword is myſtically vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood a twofold impediment or means, by which we be now debarred from the celeſtiall Paradiſe: the firſt inuiſible, of the inuiſible ſpirits and deuils, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> the laſt chapter, verſe 12. <hi>For we wreſtle not againſt fleſh and bloud, but againſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, againſt powers, and againſt the gouernours of this world, the Princes of darkneſſe, againſt ſpirituall wickedneſſes, which are in high places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond impediment (as theſe Authors ſay) myſtically ſignified by the fiery ſword, is the perpetuall fight of fleſh and bloud in our ſpirituall battell, as well in proſperitie as aduerſitie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Sauiours words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. chap. 12. verſe: <hi>The kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force:</hi> and that of <hi>Iob; Militia eſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta hominis ſuper terram.</hi>

                  <p>What was the cauſe, why Adam and his poſteritie were baniſhed out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe? wherein two auncient errours are refuted as touching originall ſinne.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>TVrrianus</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Towres alledgeth as an ancient opinion of diuers Doctors, that originall ſinne was that, which the ſoule had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted before it was infuſed into the body: which opinion ſeemeth firſt to haue beene taken from <hi>Origenes,</hi> who held that the ſoules of men being firſt created altogether in heauen, were caſt downe thence, into this vale of miſery, and ioyned vnto theſe materiall, and groſſe ſubſtances of our bodies, in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of their ſinne committed in heauen, before their vnion to their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:17022:127"/>
               <p>But this is euidently convinced as falſe, out of many places of Scripture: for if originall ſinne was contracted in heauen, how was it contracted by <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, and if we did all contract it by one, how did wee all contract it in our ſelues, by our ſelues, according to that of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 5. chap. verſ. 12. <hi>By one man ſinne entred into the world, and death by ſinne, ſo death went ouer all men, foraſmuch as all men haue ſinned.</hi> verſ. 16. <hi>Neither is the gift ſo, as that, which entred in by one, that ſinned; for the fault came of one offence vnto condemnation, but the gift is of many offences to iuſtification.</hi> verſ. 18, &amp; 19. <hi>As by the offence of one the fault came on all men to condemnation; ſo by the iuſtifying of one, the benefit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded toward all men, to the iuſtification of life.</hi> Where wee may manifeſtly ſee contrapoſed, death, and life; iuſtice, and iniuſtice; condemnation, and iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; theſe as proceeding from the obedience of Chriſt; thoſe as flowing from the diſobedience of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond opinion in this point, is, that our originall ſinne doth not conſiſt
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:17022:128"/> in any qualitie, or accident inherent in the ſubſtance of our bodies, or ſoules, or in any priuation of any excellencie, or good qualitie, which wee ought to haue retained in our ſoules, but euen in the ſubſtance of our corporall, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall nature: the reaſon is, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is not conformable to the law of God is ſinne; but all our nature is corrupt, and auerſe from the law of God, therefore the whole nature of man both body and ſoule being thus corrupt, and become abominable in the ſight of God, is ſinne.</p>
               <p>But thus it would follow, as <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> well vrgeth againſt the <hi>Manich<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es,</hi> (who held ſome things to be euill, euen of their owne nature) it would follow (I ſay) that God were the author of ſinne, ſeeing he is the author of nature. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as <hi>S. Auſtine</hi> ſaith of the Angell, ſo I of man: <hi>Diabolus natura est Angelus, ſed quod natura eſt, Dei opus est: quod verò diabolus est, vitio ſuo eſt, vtendo male naturae ſuae bono: opera verò eius mala, quae vitia dicuntur, actus ſunt, non res.</hi> The Deuill by nature is an Angel,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:17022:128"/> and this is Gods worke: but that hee is a Deuill, commeth of his owne ſinne, by the euill vſe of his good nature: ſo that his euill workes which are called vices, are the actions of his nature, not nature it ſelfe or his Angelicall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>After the ſame manner, God of his infinite goodnes created man good in ſubſtance, in nature excellent, in his powers perfect, and in eſſence of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour creatures the moſt eminent: but he by his will abuſing Gods gifts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued his powers, and depriued his nature of theſe ſupernaturall gifts, which were made connaturall vnto his firſt creation: not that either his nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came formally ſinne; or that his ſinne was tranſformed in ſubſtance, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: leaſt that he, who is the author of nature, ſhould alſo be iudged the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſinne: but that man freely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting himſelfe, vnto the breach of Gods commandement, voluntarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued himſelfe of thoſe ſupernaturall graces, which according to the former decree of God, were due vnto his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:17022:129"/> eſtate of innocencie. Inſomuch that all the goodnes, beauty, and graces, which before were connaturall vnto him, were beſtowed by God: and all the euill which was preternaturall vnto him, and accidentary vnto his nature, was deriued from himſelfe, according to that of the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> chap. 13. verſ. 9. <hi>Thy perdition is of thy ſelfe, but in me is thy helpe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is moſt euident, that our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture depraued with ſinne, muſt needs be diſtinguiſhed from that ſinne, which depraueth nature, as the man infected with any maladie, or ſickneſſe, is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the qualitie, or maladie infecting the man.</p>

                  <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> likewiſe, ſeemeth to bee of the ſame opinion, in the 7. chap. of the epiſtle of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the Romanes, where propounding this queſtion, how ſinne doth dwell in the fleſh, ſeeing it is not any ſubſtance, but the priuation of goodnes? he anſwereth, <hi>ecce primi ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis corpus corruptu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt per peccatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c. Behold</hi> (ſaith this Father) <hi>the body of the first man was corrupted by ſinne; and the corruption by reaſon of the offence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in the body, retaining the force of Gods ſentence, denounced againſt Adam; by whoſe fellowſhip, and ſociety the ſoule is ſpotted with ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But certainely, if wee duely ponder the aforeſaid places, we ſhall eaſily find, that neither Auſtine, nor any other of the Fathers is of this opinion; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the meaning of S. Auſtine in the places aboue alleadged, is, that concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence is not any ſubſtance, or part of ſubſtance; but rather a qualitie, or affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:17022:130"/> or effect of an ill qualitie: and therefore it is moſt fitly compared to a diſeaſe, not becauſe it is diſtinguiſhed from the ſenſitiue appetite; but becauſe it is the very appetite, and power it ſelfe now depraued, which is a qualitie, and (as the Diuines tearme it) <hi>affectio morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> a ſickly, corrupt, or infected affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or inclination.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe it doth preuent, or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſway reaſon, which ought to bee the gouerneſſe, and rule ouer all humane actions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe it is depriued of originall iuſtice, which in our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, was a power aboue nature, yet connaturalized (if I may ſo tearme it) vnto their nature, as well for their dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in matter of nature, as for their helpe, and furtherance in actions of grace: inſomuch that while their wills were ruled by reaſon, they were alwaies ſubiect to their Creator: and likewiſe directed in all things belonging both to nature, and grace.</p>
               <p>True it is (as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth often repeat) that the ſoule is corrupted by
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:17022:131"/> the fleſh, as the liquour, by the corrupt and vncleane veſſell: not becauſe that there was any ſuch quality, as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, deriued into the ſoule by the ſinne of <hi>Adam:</hi> but rather becauſe the ſoule is infuſed into the body, which deſcended of the defiled ſeede of <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore doth contract this ſinne, by which it is truly ſaid to be polluted.</p>
               <p>And according to this interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wee are alſo to vnderſtand, that which the Maſter of the Sentences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue alleadged, doth falſely cite out of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> being rather the words of the ordinary gloſſe vpon that of Rom. chap. 7. <hi>But that ſinne which dwelleth in me:</hi> for the Author of the gloſſe addeth vnto the reſt of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his word, <hi>cuius conſortio anima maculatur peccato:</hi> by whoſe ſociety the ſoule is defiled with ſinne: which by no wiſe can bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, by reaſon of any infectious qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity deriued from the body, and thence tranſfuſed into the ſoule, but according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as hath beene partly explicated alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſhall bee heereafter more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:17022:131"/>
               <p>And this may be further demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, euen by reaſon, for firſt, either this <hi>morbida qualitas,</hi> this infectious quality was naturally produced in our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and thence transfuſed into our wils, or ſupernaturally: the firſt is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe ſinne had no ſuch naturall force or power in <hi>Adam,</hi> otherwiſe it ſhould haue had the ſame effect likewiſe in all the poſterity of <hi>Adam:</hi> which euen our aduerſaries doe deny, ſeeing there is no reaſon, why it ſhould bee ſo auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of one more then of all.</p>
               <p>Or peraduenture this quality was not produced by naturall means, but by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall, not by any naturall power of man, but by the ſupernaturall of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and as ſome hath aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to pronounce, <hi>ex ſola Dëi volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,</hi> meerly by the will of him, to whom nothing is impoſſible, <hi>cui non eſt impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile omne verbum,</hi> to whoſe will all doe obey.</p>
               <p>But certainely if wee waigh this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, either in the naturall principles of true philoſophy, or ſupernaturall of grace, we ſhall finde the aforeſayd poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:17022:132"/> and ſolution to bee moſt diſſonant to both, ſeeing that both doe euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrate vnto vs the repugnance and contradiction of this; that hee who is the fountaine of all goodneſſe, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goodneſſe it ſelfe, ſhould bee the particular and naturall efficient, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cauſe of that which is <hi>ſummum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> the greateſt euill, nothing more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant then <hi>ſummum bonum</hi> and <hi>ſummum malum,</hi> nothing ſo vnlike in their being, ſo nothing ſo improportionate in their cauſalities and effects. Wherfore, as it is impoſſible for goodneſſe it ſelfe not to be good, ſo is it no leſſe contradiction to the particular cauſe of euill, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſeeing that ſinne is <hi>ſummum malum,</hi> the greateſt euill poſſible, and ſeeing likewiſe of all ſinnes, this in ſome ſort is the greateſt, as which is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall and fountaine of all other actual ſinnes, as it doth imply contradiction, that God ſhould be the particular cauſe of other actuall ſinnes, ſo it doth <hi>à forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori</hi> imply the ſame, that he ſhould be in any wiſe of this originall; yea, euen na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reaſon was a ſufficient light of this

                  <hi>Albertus, Pighius,</hi> and <hi>Catharinus</hi> fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inconueniences of the aforeſayd opinions, fell into another extreame: to wit, that there was no other originall ſinne in <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, then the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> by which he firſt of all, then all his diſcendence were reputed ſinners; hee inwardly, they outwardly; and as the Schooles terme it, by an outward denomination, to wit, by <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne inward to <hi>Adam,</hi> imputed onely to them, as though it had been really their own, and actually committed by them, whereas in very deede they had none proper, or inherent, but <hi>Adams</hi> onely
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:17022:133"/> by imputation, not by reall appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Which opinion may fitly bee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the example of a man, who being adopted by a King, as his ſonne and heire apparant to the Crowne, ſhould haue granted vnto him and to his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, all the priuiledges annexed vnto his adoption and principality: but yet with this condition, that if this Prince ſo adopted ſhould commit any treaſon againſt his father, both he and his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould not onely loſe the aforeſayd titles and priuiledges, but alſo ſhould be accounted traytours vnto the Crowne. In which cauſe, although the poſterity of this man had not committed any fault in themſelues; yet were they to be reputed morally as traytours, and to haue committed high treaſon in their head and pregenitor.</p>
               <p>After the ſame manner (as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of this opinion auerre) was the compact made betweene God, and our firſt father <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo that if hee had not tranſgreſſed the commandement of his Creator, eating of the forbidden fruit,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:17022:134"/> he and his, ſhould haue beene tranſlated out of the terrene Paradiſe, vnto the kingdome of heauen. But this compact being broken by our firſt father, both he, and wee loſt our right vnto the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe, for which wee were created; he in himſelfe, and we in him: Not that as he had inherent in him the ſpot and blemiſh of originall ſin, wee alſo ſhould haue it: but only by an externe denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation (as the Diuines terme it) becauſe we had really the effects thereof, &amp; our firſt father, in whom we were all contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, had really both the cauſe &amp; effect, the ſin (I meane) of diſobedience and the priuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of originall iuſtice, together with all other effects therupon enſuing.</p>
               <p>This opinion is gathered out of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 5. <hi>In whom (to wit) in Adam all haue ſinned,</hi> as who would ſay, wee had not ſinned originally, but onely in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi> wee haue not therefore originally ſinned in our ſelues, &amp; conſequently if wee haue not ſinned in our ſelues, but only in <hi>Adam,</hi> our ſin only is in <hi>Adam,</hi> as it is only by <hi>Adam,</hi> not in our ſelues, as it was not committed by our ſelues: in

               <p>This may alſo ſeeme the opinion of <hi>S. Auſtine</hi> in his 3. booke <hi>de libero arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trio cap.</hi> 20. where he ſaith that we are all
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:17022:135"/>

It was therefore in vs by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne denomination, inwardly affecting him, but outwardly onely denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vs.</p>
               <p>But if it bee ſo as <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaith, that <hi>wee were all originally defiled with the ſinne of our firſt father,</hi> if wee had alſo beſides this ſome other inherent origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne, wee ſhould haue two kindes of originall ſinnes, the one by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the other by inheſion; the one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in <hi>Adam</hi> only, the other in vs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued from <hi>Adam,</hi> which is to ſpeake without ground of Scripture, which onely maketh mention of one originall ſinne, by which all bee truly called ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Omnes peccauerunt in Adamo,</hi> all haue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Adam,</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi> hee ſaith, not in themſelues, and conſequently none ſuch did truly poſſeſſe them.</p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:17022:135"/>
               <p>By this wee may ſee what colour of truth may be giuen to falſitie, yea euen vnto hereſie, ſuch as this ſeemeth to be; for if originall ſinne bee nothing elſe in our poſteritie, but the puniſhment and ſinne of our firſt father <hi>Adam,</hi> for which all his poſteritie is puniſhed, certainly after the ſame manner, the ſonnes alſo of any other of his poſteritie, who as the Scripture witneſſeth, are iuſtly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for their fathers offences, might rightly be ſaid to haue contracted ſo many originall ſinnes, as bee ſinnes pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable in them by reaſon of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers tranſgreſſions: which without all queſtion were moſt abſurd, and yet the conſequence ſeemeth moſt euident.</p>
               <p>For if originall ſinne (according to this laſt opinion) bee nothing elſe but the ſinne of our firſt father <hi>Adam,</hi> as it is puniſhable in vs; no queſtion, but by the ſame reaſon, as many ſinnes of our fore-fathers as are puniſhable in vs, euen vnto the third or fourth generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may as well bee called originall ſinnes in vs, though they bee not really inherent in our ſoules, or powers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:17022:136"/> but onely are ſaid to be in vs by an externe denomination, or name procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from our parents.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if our ſinne bee nothing elſe but the ſinne of our firſt parent, as it is imputed vnto vs from him as our head; certainly as that is blotted in him by his repentance, ſo it ſhould alſo bee blotted in vs by the ſame repentance: for if his ſinne could be ſufficient for the condemnation of all, why ſhould not his repentance be ſufficient for all? eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially it being nothing in vs but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne denomination, or bare name ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from his ſinne, which now being waſhed away in him. ſhould of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie be likewiſe blotted in vs, <hi>nulla ſiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem forma, ſiue interna ſiue externa, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt denominare, niſi eo modo quo eſt:</hi> for queſtionleſſe no forme, being taken away, can denominate as when it was preſent. This forme therefore being an externe forme, which neuer had any vnion in our ſoules, or powers thereof, could neuer, euen when it was preſent, denominate our ſoules inwardly ſinful, much leſſe now, when it is altogether
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:17022:136"/> blotted out of the firſt ſubiect, wherein it was really inherent, but rather now it ſhould giue no denomination at all, and conſequently none of the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould truly be ſaid to bee borne in ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne, ſeeing that forme, from which they were ſaid to bee borne in ſinne, is quite aboliſhed and blotted out euen in the firſt ſubiect, from whence it ſhould proceed vnto all.</p>
               <p>Finally, as <hi>Dauid</hi> witneſſeth, wee are all borne in iniquitie, and our mother conceiued vs in ſinne; and <hi>S. Paul, All haue ſinned in Adam:</hi> but this could not be true, if ſo be that wee were onely to bee tearmed originally ſinners, in that our firſt father <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned; for his ſinne being blotted out, the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo proceeding from it, ſhould be taken away, ſeeing that no forme can any longer denominate, then whiles it is preſent, and after the manner that it is ſo. Therefore as it could not really and intrinſecally denominate the poſteritie of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſinners, euen when it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, according to the foreſaid doctrine; ſo now when it is altogether taken away
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:17022:137"/> in his root and firſt origine, it cannot in any wiſe denominate vs ſinners, which is euidently againſt the Scriptures, which repeat ſo often, that <hi>all mankinde was conceiued in ſinne, and to haue ſinned in Adam,</hi> hee onely excepted, who as goodneſſe it ſelfe, in no wiſe could bee ſubiect to this ſo great euill; and as man, was hypoſtatically vnited with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon of the bleſſed Trinitie, and predeſtinated to bee the generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the world, from this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall deluge of ſinne, and therefore could not be defiled with any ſinne.</p>

               <p>The firſt argument of this hereſie is that which <hi>Iulian</hi> the Pelagian vſed againſt <hi>S. Auſtine;</hi> becauſe it is eſſentiall to all ſinnes, to be voluntary; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be voluntary vnto infants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the vſe of reaſon, ſeeing that as the Philoſophers ſay, and proue, <hi>nihil concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitum quin praecognitum,</hi> nothing is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, deſired, or ſought after, which is not firſt knowne; infants therefore who haue no vſe of reaſon, can haue no abuſe of will by conſent vnto a foreknowne euill; and where there can be no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient foreknowledge or diſtinction of good from euill, there queſtionleſſe can be no ſinne.</p>
               <p>Yea this ſeemeth to be confirmed by <hi>S.

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:17022:144"/> without his conſent. Wherefore Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Biſhop</hi> againſt <hi>M.

               </p>
               <p>To this argument of <hi>Iulian</hi> peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſome will ſay, that originall ſinne is voluntary in the infants, not by their owne proper actuall will, as who can haue none ſuch, but by the will of their firſt father <hi>Adam,</hi> which after a ſort may be ſaid to be the will of all his poſteritie, ſeeing he was the head of them all, and therefore that by his voluntary tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion all <hi>Adams</hi> poſteritie may bee ſaid to haue ſinned in him.</p>
               <p>But this ſeemeth not to ſatisfie for originall ſinne, if wee will conſider well the nature of it: and as all the aduerſe part doth hold, <hi>verè auertit à Deo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vuli voluntatem, &amp; cam conuertit ad bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num mutabile;</hi> it doth truly auert the will of the infants from God, vnto an apparant and mutable good, yea euen
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:17022:144"/> to the deuill; therefore the will of our parent, and his ſinne, is in no wiſe to cauſe originall ſinne in vs. Secondly (as true Philoſophie teacheth) no cauſe can produce that which it hath not in it ſelfe, either virtually, or formally, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth any cauſe produce any thing, but after the manner that it containeth the thing which is to bee produced, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther formally, if ſo bee that it hath the ſame forme, ſpecies, or kinde, which the effect hath; or virtually, if it containe it in a more perfect degree and meaſure. But certainly, neither our firſt parent <hi>Adam,</hi> neither our immediate parents now regenerated in Chriſt, haue in any wiſe the guiltineſſe of originall ſinne at the time of our generation; how can it therefore poſſibly come to paſſe, that any ſuch guilt of originall ſinne ſhould proceed from them vnto vs? Certainly this could not proceed from any matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall act, ſeeing that was and is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in all lawes, both of nature, <hi>Moſes,</hi> and grace: how therefore could that which is a ſinne, and conſequently vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, proceed from that which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:17022:145"/> lawfull? Thirdly, the actions of our externall powers, as of ſeeing, ſmelling, taſting, and the like, are in no wiſe voluntary, or ſo tearmed, but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly only, or (as the Philoſophers tearme is) by an extrinſecall denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or name deriued from our will; and this, becauſe they haue no free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or libertie in themſelues inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but only as they are directed from the inward facultie of the will: and therefore as they haue no libertie or free will, but only by an externe deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; ſo neither haue they any ſinne inwardly inherent, but onely as they are commanded, or proceed from the will. Therefore after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſeeing the ſoules and willes of the infants haue no libertie, or freedome of choice, but only by an externe denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, outwardly deriued from the will of <hi>Adam,</hi> now altogether paſt, and of his ſinne, now forgiuen; it muſt needs follow, that they cannot in any wiſe bee ſaid to haue contracted any ſin, but only by an externe denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, proceeding from the ſin of <hi>Adam.</hi>

               <p>Fourthly, that which in it ſelfe is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods law, neither in any wiſe contradicting the ſame, cannot be the cauſe of that which is againſt the law of God: wherefore ſeeing that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie, or the matrimoniall act, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods law, it cannot bee the cauſe or occaſion of originall ſinne in the infant, which is againſt Gods law.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, originall ſinne cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from <hi>Adam</hi> vnto his poſteritie, neither as from the morall cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, neither as from a phyſicall, naturall, or reall cauſe: not morally, becauſe as death did proceed from ſinne; ſo life, if he had perſeuered, ſhould haue procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from grace, and originall iuſtice, which was a gift giuen vnto all our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in <hi>Adam,</hi> not <hi>per modum meriti,</hi> by way of merit, (as ſome haue dreamed) but gratis: otherwiſe (as the Apoſtle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth, <hi>Romans</hi> the 11. chapter) grace ſhould haue been no grace. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſequently, neither doth origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne paſſe vnto vs his poſteritie by way of demerit, or as a morall effect of ſinne, ſeeing that the ſame reaſon which
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:17022:146"/> doth vrge for the transfuſion of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit or ſinne vnto vs, doth alſo vrge for the transfuſion of grace. Wherefore ſeeing he could not be the meritorious cauſe of our grace, becauſe it doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie contradiction, to be deſerued, and yet to be grace, a free gift, and graciouſly giuen; neither can he be conſequently the morall cauſe of our originall ſinne. Neither finally can the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> bee the reall or phyſicall cauſe of our ſinne, ſeeing that his ſinne, whereof ours ſhould proceed, is now neither actuall, nor virtuall; not actuall, becauſe it is forgiuen; not virtuall, for that then it ſhould be latent in the generatiue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or ſeed; which cannot poſſibly bee, becauſe then it ſhould be attributed to God, who is cauſe of the generatiue power; ſeeing (as the Philoſophers ſay) <hi>cauſa cauſae eſt cauſa effectus illius ſecundae cauſae,</hi> the cauſe of any ſecond cauſe is the cauſe of the effect proceeding from the ſecond cauſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, there cannot bee aſſigned any time or moment, in which the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> doe or can contract this origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:17022:146"/> ſinne: therefore both according to true Diuinitie and Philoſophie, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be that we doe really and inwardly in our ſoules contract any ſuch ſinne, but rather wee are called <hi>ſinners in Adam,</hi> and are ſaid by the Apoſtle to haue ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> by reaſon onely of his fall, who was our head. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent ſeemeth certaine, becauſe this ſinne can neither infect our ſoules in the firſt inſtant of their creation or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, otherwiſe the ſoule ſhould haue it from her creation, and conſequently it might bee attributed to Almightie God, as to the author thereof, ſeeing that as true Philoſophie teacheth, <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio quae ſimul incipit cum eſſe rei, eſt illi ab agente, à quo habet eſſe;</hi> the action which beginneth iointly with the being of the effect, is from that cauſe, from which it hath being.</p>

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:17022:147"/> to God, which were blaſphemous.</p>
               <p>Neither could this ſinne bee contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by vs in the inſtant, in which our ſoules were infuſed into our bodies, ſeeing that the immediate ſubiect of ſinne is not the body, but the ſoule, or ſome of the powers of the ſoule: ſeeing therefore no inſtant can be aſſigned, in which the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> are infected with this originall crime, it followeth neceſſarily, both according to the grounds of reaſon, and Scripture, that there is no ſuch infection or corruption inherent in our ſoules.</p>
               <p>For the better vnderſtanding of this fundamentall point, ſo controuerted in all ages, we muſt note, firſt, that origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne is called <hi>peccatum naturae,</hi> the ſinne of nature, according to that of <hi>Paul, Epheſians</hi> 2. <hi>Wee were by nature the ſonnes of wrath:</hi> becauſe ſinne did ſpot, defile, or rather corrupt the whole maſſe of humane nature in our firſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Adam,</hi> from whom, as firſt head and fountaine, it hath beene and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this ſinne is called the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:17022:147"/> ſinne of the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> chap. 1. <hi>Behold the Lambe of God, which taketh away the ſinne of the world;</hi> becauſe all men were defiled with this, one onely excepted, God and man, by whom al others were redeemed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is alſo tearmed <hi>peccatum humanae conditionis,</hi> the ſinne common to all humane nature; becauſe there is not any (Chriſt only excepted) which doth not vndergoe this yoke. So <hi>Ierome</hi> explicating that of the 50. Pſalme, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I am conceiued in iniquities,</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Hieron. ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cap. <hi>4.</hi> Ezechiel.</note> 
                  <hi>not in the iniquities of my mother, but in the iniquities of humane nature,</hi> which are generall to all humane nature, or which hath defiled all mankinde.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> is called <hi>peccatum radicale,</hi> the radicall ſinne, or root of ſinne; becauſe wee being now depriued by it of originall iuſtice, which as it was in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo ſhould it alſo haue beene in vs, an antidote againſt all inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate deſires: but now our inordinate appetite and concupiſcence (which is the root of all euill) is let looſe, to the ouerthrow of all true libertie.</p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:17022:148"/>
               <p>Laſtly, wee muſt note this difference betweene the originall and the actuall ſinne of euery particular man beſides <hi>Adam,</hi> that the actuall ſinne is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the actuall will and conſent of euery ſinner, but the originall commeth only by <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne and tranſgreſſion, and thereby is transfuſed and paſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. Wherefore God ſpeaking not of the former, but of the latter, <hi>Ezechiel</hi> chap. 18. ſaith, <hi>The ſoule that hath ſinned ſhall die: the ſonne ſhall not beare the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of the father, neither the father the ſonnes iniquitie: the righteouſneſſe of the righteous ſhall be vpon him, and the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie of the wicked vpon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the contrary ſide, originall ſinne being the ſinne of nature, requireth only the free libertie of the firſt and principall head of nature, becauſe his will is reputed as the vniuerſall will of all: whence it is, that wee muſt not thinke, that when the childe is firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and the ſoule firſt infuſed into the body, that then (I ſay) it may bee deemed to ſinne, but rather that then it is conceiued in ſinne: ſo <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:17022:148"/> that <hi>he was conceiued in ſinne,</hi> not that he ſinned in his conception. For though both inſinuate a true ſinne in vs, yet the one, that is, originall ſinne, is thereby ſignified to be deriued from <hi>Adam</hi> vnto vs, yea alſo to be inherent in vs: the other, that is, actuall ſinne, is from our ſelues, and of our ſelues; whence it is, that the perſon of <hi>Adam</hi> was firſt infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with this originall contagion, and then his nature: but in vs contrariwiſe, firſt the nature is infected, then the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon depraued.</p>
               <p>Theſe things preſuppoſed, my firſt concluſion is, that it is a point of catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith, that all thoſe who deſcend of the ſeede of <hi>Adam</hi> by ordinary meanes, are infected with this generall maladie of originall ſinne. Wherefore God threatneth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. <hi>that he whoſe fleſh is not circumciſed, ſhall be blotted out of the booke of God,</hi>

               <p>But hence peraduenture it may bee further vrged, that though God be not the author of this concupiſcence, as it hath the force, and malice of ſinne, yet that he is the author of the ſame thing, that is originall ſinne, to wit, of that <hi>fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes peccati,</hi> fewell of ſinne, concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence or inclination vnto ſinne, which alſo is no ſmall abſurditie. I anſwer that this is no abſurditie, but neceſſarie, no hereſie, but catholique doctrine; ſo that it be not granted that he is author of it, as it is ſinne, but of that materiall,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:17022:153"/> or thing which by mans wickedneſſe is made ſinne, yea which is good as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from God; though euill and wicked, as flowing from man, Gods concourſe being altogether good, mans determination euill, as detorting it to euill; as the light of the Sunne of it ſelf pure and good, is oftentimes vſed and abuſed to euill, yea of this we haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite examples, in which our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are driuen to auerre the like.</p>
               <p>For who doubteth, but that Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, (<hi>qui operatur omnia in omnibus,</hi> who worketh all reall actions in all things whatſoeuer) is alſo the vniuerſall cauſe of euery reall action, and habit of ſinne? and yet neuertheleſſe no man will be ſo blinde, and blaſphemous, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to attribute to his infinite goodnes, that which hath infinite malice in it, as it is againſt that infinite goodnes.</p>
               <p>The reaſon therefore, why it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be attributed vnto man, as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſe of it, then vnto God, who is the vniuerſall cauſe of all, is, becauſe man hauing the vniuerſall concourſe of God vnto good, determineth it, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:17022:153"/> to his euill inclination vnto naught, and ſo committeth that nothing which in it ſelfe is ſin, and priuation of good.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may be obiected againſt originall ſinne, that if that priuation of originall iuſtice which ought to haue beene in vs, and of which we were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, were in any wiſe to be tearmed originall ſinne, it would follow, that there were not one onely originall ſinne in euery one of vs, but many: for ſeeing that there is not one onely culpable priuation of that origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall iuſtice, which <hi>Adam</hi> had in Paradiſe, but alſo of faith, hope, charitie, and of all other graces, conſequent vnto the fore-ſaid originall iuſtice, why ſhould there not be by the like reaſon as many originall ſinnes, as there bee priuations of ſupernaturall gifts, and graces?</p>
               <p>The anſwer is eaſie, for that all theſe depriuations of graces are deriued of one, which is of our originall iuſtice, which ſhould haue beene the roote, and fountaine of them all.</p>
               <p>The third obiection may be, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is not in the power of any to
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:17022:154"/> attaine to the grace of God, being in ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne, conſequently the formall of originall ſinne cannot be any priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grace, but rather a negation. I anſwer, that becauſe once it was in the power of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſuppoſing the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made by Almighty God with him, that the ſaid ſupernaturall forme of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall iuſtice ſhould haue beene by his perſeuerance paſſed vnto his poſteritie; hence it is that this abſence of originall iuſtice in <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſteritie, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a priuation, then negation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it may be obiected, that as in the opinion of <hi>Scotus,</hi> whenſoeuer the act of ſinne is paſt, the ſinner may truly be called a ſinner only by reaſon of the relation of the act paſt, which is not as yet forgiuen; ſo it ſeemeth, that the ſame might be ſaid in originall ſin, that though the act of <hi>Adam</hi> be paſt, yet that this might be imputed vnto vs his poſteritie, onely by reaſon of the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we might haue from his act, and this without any other priuation, negation, or concupiſcence remaining in vs.</p>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:17022:154"/>
               <p>I anſwer, that although this be the opinion of <hi>Albertus</hi> and <hi>Catharinus,</hi> yet that in no wiſe it may be admitted, for ſo we are not really, and internally ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in <hi>Adam,</hi> but onely by an externe denomination of his ſinne, which (as wee haue already ſhowne) is moſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous.</p>

                  <p>Of the manner how originall ſinne doth deſcend from Adam to his poſteritie.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere hath beene three diſtinct he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies about this point: the firſt, which making no difference betweene the ſoules of men, and other liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, held, that as the ſoules of all other creatures compounded of matter and forme are produced with dependencie of their ſubiect, and materiall ſubſtance: ſo likewiſe, the ſoules of men. And that therefore they were infected and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the coniunction with the body.</p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:17022:155"/>
               <p>The ſecond opinion, no leſſe abſurd in Philoſophy, then erroneous in Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, is that one ſoule doth concurre vnto the generation of another, as the whole man, wholy to the production of another.</p>
               <p>The third, and worſt opinion of all doth attribute the production of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne in our ſoules vnto the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power of God, ſpotting thereby his infinite goodneſſe by the too much extending of his omnipotence, euen vnto that, which rather argueth impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie, then omnipotencie.</p>
               <p>Now therefore the true cauſe of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne in vs (as the Scripture often witneſſeth) was our firſt father <hi>Adam,</hi> by reaſon of his tranſgreſſion of the commandement of God, but this not by reall influx and concourſe, but by morall: firſt becauſe hee could not of himſelfe, and by his owne nature paſſe vnto his poſteritie any ſuch effect, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ſeeing that, that ſinne now is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether paſt; yea, at leaſt way according to the guiltineſſe thereof, it is waſhed away by the blood of Chriſt, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:17022:155"/> to the decree of Almighty God, he was the morall cauſe, inſomuch as the infuſion of originall iuſtice into vs depended vpon his will, by not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, according to the compact made betweene him and God: hee therefore eating of the forbidden fruit, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed neceſſarily priuation of originall iuſtice in our ſoules, and conſequently originall ſinne in it ſelfe.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THe reaſon of this doubt, is becauſe (as the preacher ſaith) <hi>a muliere initium peccati,</hi> ſinne had his beginning from the woman, and through her all doe die, it ſeemeth therfore that though ſhee onely had ſinned, the ſame ſinne ſhould haue beene imputed vnto vs all; yea all ſhould haue contracted that ſin in her and by hers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>S. Hierome</hi> &amp; <hi>S.

<pb n="305" facs="tcp:17022:157"/> vnto her poſteritie, though <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, ſeeing that theſe words, <hi>in whom all haue ſinned,</hi> according to the interpretation of <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> and <hi>S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> are to be applied vnto the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as who was the firſt cauſe of mans woe.</p>
               <p>Although I can gather nothing alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether certaine about this point, either out of the holy Scriptures or Fathers, yet neuertheleſſe it ſeemeth more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the whole cauſe of originall ſinne in vs ought to bee reduced vnto <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo that by <hi>Adams</hi> conſent onely, and not by <hi>Eues</hi> we were to be borne in originall iniuſtice.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is, for that all the Fathers (<hi>S. Hierome,</hi> and <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) who doe interpret the aforeſaid place, doe vnderſtand it of <hi>Adam,</hi> and not of <hi>Eue;</hi> yea it ſeemeth that this may be gathered out of the words of S. Paul 1. Corinth. 15. <hi>As in Adam all do die, ſo all ſhall be reviued in Chriſt,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore venerable <hi>Bede</hi> is plainely of this opinion in the 14 of his queſtions tomo 8, where he ſaith, <hi>originale peccatum tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:17022:158"/> originem ex Adamo non ex diabolo, quia ex diabolo non propagamur, non ab Eua, quia vir, id eſt Adam, non eſt à mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere, ſed mulier a viro; ex quo ſequitur, Adamo non peccante, etiamſi Eua peccaſſet, non futurum in nobis peccatum.</hi> That o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall ſinne hath his beginning from Adam onely, not from the Deuill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee are not begot by the Deuill, neither of Eue, becauſe the man, to wit, Adam is not of the woman, but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the man; wherevpon it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that though Eue had ſinned, if A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam had not, we ſhould not haue been borne in ſinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aquinas</hi> giueth another reaſon, <hi>quia mulier paſsiue ſe habet ad generationem prolis,</hi> becauſe the woman doth onely concurre paſſiuely vnto generation, but whether this be true or no, <hi>quod medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum eſt curent medici, tractent fabrilia fabri;</hi> one thing ſeemeth moſt certaine that this dependeth more on the ſecret will of Almighty God, then of any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reaſon and conſequence, which may be deduced out of the principles of nature.</p>

                  <p>What puniſhments be due vnto originall ſinne in this life.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Anſwer briefly, that the firſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due vnto originall ſinne, and which was firſt of all inflicted vpon man, was the priuation of originall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, as proceeding from God, and as it did ſubdue the inferiour portion of the ſoule vnto the ſuperiour, and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour vnto God.</p>
               <p>The ſecond puniſhment proceeding from the firſt, was in the ſoule and her powers, both vnderſtanding and will: not that any thing eſſentiall either to the ſoule or her powers, is taken away, but that they are not ſo able to exerciſe their functions, as they ſhould haue beene being endued with originall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
               <p>The third puniſhment of originall ſinne, was, that both <hi>Adam</hi> and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie became thereby ſubiect to all
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:17022:159"/> corporall infirmities, yea euen vnto death it ſelfe, and many other expreſſed in the third chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> verſ. 16. <hi>I will greatly increaſe thy ſorrowes and thy conceptions: in ſorrow thou ſhalt bring forth children; thy deſire ſhall bee to thy husband, and hee ſhall haue the rule ouer thee.</hi> Verſe 17. <hi>Vnto Adam hee ſaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt hearkened vnto the voice of thy wife, and haſt eaten of the tree, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the which I commanded, ſaying, thou ſhalt not eat of it; curſed is the ground for thy ſake, in ſorrow ſhalt thou eat of it all the dayes of thy life.</hi> Verſe 18. <hi>Thornes alſo and thiſtles ſhall it bring forth vnto thee, and thou ſhalt eat of the hearbes of the field</hi> Verſe 19. <hi>In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat bread, till thou bee turned againe to the ground; for out of it was thou taken, for duſt thou art, and into duſt ſhalt thou be turned againe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſeeing this naturall death could not naturally bee effectuated ſo long as <hi>Adam</hi> was in Paradiſe, becauſe the tree of life retained his vertue, wherewith man might renew his age: therefore Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God addeth in the ſame chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

And ſo he droue out man, and at the Eaſt ſide of the garden of Eden he ſet the Cherubins, and a flaming ſword, which turned euery way to keepe the way of the tree of life.</hi>

               <p>AL the difficultie of this point is wholly as concerning thoſe who depart out of this world without bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, whereby the guilt of originall ſinne (as many hold) ſhould haue been taken away: wherefore the queſtion is, what becommeth of theſe, or what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is due vnto them for this ſin, ſuppoſing that it be not taken away, as
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:17022:160"/> certainly it is not, at leaſtway in thoſe that are not comprehended in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of grace.</p>
               <p>The common opinion of the ſchoole-Diuines in this point, is, that the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents vnbaptiſed, either <hi>baptiſmo ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinis, fluminis,</hi> or <hi>flaminis,</hi> either with the baptiſme of bloud, to wit, of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome; or of the holy Ghoſt, by ſome ſupernaturall act or habit, ſufficient to iuſtification; or finally by the ordinary baptiſme of water, that ſuch (I ſay) are puniſhed with the loſſe of their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall bleſſedneſſe, though not with any other ſenſible puniſhment.</p>
               <p>This is expreſly the opinion of <hi>S.

               </p>

But if theſe be not ſo certainly <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> workes, the ſecond at leaſt is of the learned Biſhop <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> and the other of ſome learned Author: yea whoſoeuer be the authors of thoſe, it is moſt certaine that <hi>Auſtine</hi> was of this opinion in his 14. ſermon of the words of the Apoſtle, where he ſaith, <hi>infantes in peccato originali diſcedentes ex hac vita, deputandos eſſe ad ſiniſtram, ad ignem aeternum: that the infants that depart out of this world in originall ſinne, are to be deputed to the left hand vnto euerlaſting fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, in his fift booke againſt <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> the 8. chapter, a little after the midſt, he auerreth, <hi>hanc poenamignis ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatam eſſe infantibus, quanta verò futura
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:17022:161"/> ſit, non audet definire: that this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fire is reſerued for infants, though</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>hee dare not define how great this puniſhment of fire ſhall be, in regard of them who depart with the guilt onely of originall ſinne.</hi> The like alſo is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probably gathered out of <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, in his 9. booke of his morals, the 12. chapter, vpon thoſe words, <hi>in turbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne conteret me,</hi> where he ſeemeth plainly to inſinuate the ſaid ſenſible puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the infants by fire; <hi>ac ſi apertè humani generis damna conſiderans dicat, as if conſidering the loſſes of mankinde he ſhould plainly ſay, with what puniſhment will that moſt iuſt and rigorous Iudge pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thoſe who are condemned for their owne fault, if he alſo eternally ſmite thoſe whom the guiltineſſe of their owne will doth not condemne?</hi> by which word of ſmiting he ſeemeth to inſinuate the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſenſe, which is by fire.</p>
               <p>Again he declareth his mind himſelf touching this ſenſible puniſhment, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe words of the ſame chap. <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicabit vulnera mea, hee ſhall multiplie my wounds;</hi> where ſpeaking of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:17022:162"/> infants, he ſaith, that <hi>perpetua tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta percipiunt, qui nihil ex propria vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate peecarunt; that thoſe who haue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in nothing by their owne proper will, receiue perpetuall torments:</hi> which words of perpetuall torments muſt needs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a ſenſible puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Yea this was the opinion of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Africa</hi> in <hi>Fulgentius</hi> his time, as is plainly out of him aboue alleaged, and more plainly in his booke of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, which booke hee wrote not onely by the approbation of all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Africa,</hi> but alſo in their names, as may be euidently ſeene by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the firſt chapter of that booke.</p>
               <p>Finally, this ſeemeth to be the ſenſe of the Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> the third chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, verſe 12. and <hi>Marke</hi> alſo the third chapter, verſe 14. where <hi>S. Iohn Baptiſt</hi> ſpeaking of our Sauiour, ſaith, that <hi>he will come with his fanne in his hand, and will make cleane the floore, and gather his wheat into his garner, but will burne vp the chaffe with vnquenchable fire:</hi> where (as wee ſee) all mankinde is but onely
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:17022:162"/> of two ſorts, the good and the bad, the wheat and the chaffe, wherof the wheat only is for the garner, that is, the good for heauen, the chaffe for the fire, the bad for thoſe intolerable torments of hell: here is no meane; all is either good, or bad; all either for eternall bleſſe, both ſenſible and ſpirituall, or eternall curſe and puniſhment, both ſenſible and ſpirituall; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is no other place or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of puniſhment, for thoſe who die with originall ſinne, innocent in their owne actions, though eternally ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred from the ſight of God, for <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne and corruption.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is ſaid in the ſame chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that <hi>euery tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, ſhall be hewen downe, and cast in the fire.</hi> Wherefore ſeeing thoſe that depart out of this world with the guilt only of originall ſinne, are vnfruitfull trees, conſequently they are to bee caſt into euerlaſting fire.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when our bleſſed Sauiour ſhall come to giue euery man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his deeds, hee will only ſeparate
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:17022:163"/> two ſorts of people, one of the right hand, another of the left, the good of the right, the bad of the left, thoſe for eternall bleſſe in the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, theſe for an eternall curſe in the vnquenchable fire of hell. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. chap. verſ. 31. <hi>And when the ſonne of man commeth in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him, then ſhall he ſit vpon the throne of his glory, and before him ſhall be gathered all nations, and he ſhall ſeparate one from another, as a ſhepheard ſeparateth the ſheepe from the goats, and hee ſhall ſet the ſheepe on the right hand, and the goats on the left.</hi> Loe here bee two ſorts of people ſignified by thoſe two kindes of beaſts, the ſheepe and the goats, the good and the bad, the ſheepe on the right hand, the goats on the left, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the two ſorts of ſentences pronounced, verſ 34. and 41. <hi>Then ſhall the King ſay to them on his right hand, come yee bleſſed of my Father, poſſeſſe the inheritance of the kingdome prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for you from the foundation of the world.</hi> Againe to the curſed hee ſaith, verſ. 41. <hi>Depart from me yee curſed vnto
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:17022:163"/> euerlaſting fire, which is prepared for the Deuill and his angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence therefore it muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that ſeeing thoſe who died in ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne imputed vnto them, as who were not in any wiſe ingraffed in the body of Chriſt, that theſe (I ſay) muſt needs according vnto the opinion of the aforeſaid Fathers bee condemned vnto vnquenchable fire, though cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is (as God willing ſhall bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated in another place) that thoſe who are in any wiſe ingraffed in Chriſt, either by the baptiſme of water, of bloud, or of the holy Ghoſt, by reaſon of originall ſinne only, ſhall neuer taſte of thoſe eternall torments prepared for the deuill and his angels.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The obiections of Simon Magus againſt the aforeſaid doctrine of the creation of man, and his placing in Paradiſe.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS there is nothing ſo manifeſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to reaſon, but hath beene oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by reaſon; ſo neither hath there beene any thing ſo euident in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but hath beene oppugned with Scripture. So the Phariſees reſiſted the Meſſias, and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> the doctrine of <hi>Moſes,</hi> eſpecially about the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>For either (ſaith hee) the God which created man was omnipotent, or not; if omnipotent, how is it that hee would that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould not fall, who neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe did fall? if he was not omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, how can he be God?</p>
               <p>To this wee anſwer, that though <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, and by his ſinne did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:17022:164"/> to the will of God; neuertheleſſe hee remained in ſome ſort conformable to the will of God: for as hee created him, endued with vnderſtanding, that thereby hee might diſcerne good from euill; ſo was hee alſo created with free will, whereby hee might embrace the good, and eſchew the euill, obey or diſobey his Lord and maker: this was the perfection in which he excelled the beaſts of the earth, <hi>paulò minor factus Angelis,</hi> in this he reſembled the pureſt Angels, yea in this hee is ſaid to bee made to the image of God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But God (ſaith <hi>Simon Magus</hi>) would not that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould haue eaten of the forbidden fruit, who neuertheleſſe did eat of that fruit; it followeth therefore that hee remained not as his Creator would haue had him to haue remained; how then can God be omnipotent, or his will alwayes fulfilled?</p>
               <p>It were neceſſary, if we ſhould fully ſatisfie this argument, to intreat more largely of the will of God, then were conuenient for this place: wherefore, that wee may briefly anſwer this obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:17022:165"/> wee muſt preſuppoſe with the Schoole-Diuines a threefold diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the will of God,<note place="margin">Aquinas <hi>1.</hi> n.i. te quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtione <hi>19.</hi> Ibidem Molina, VaſqueZ, Suarius, Sumel, Banneſius, &amp; alij plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</note> according to the diuerſitie of their proper obiects: the firſt they call his efficient, effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, or working will, by which God doth ſo effectually intend any thing, that hee performeth it actually by ſome externall operation and worke, either actually produced, or to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
               <p>The other kinde of will, which the Diuines diſtinguiſh in God, in regard of ſome obiects which he doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally produce, is called <hi>inefficax volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi> a kinde of propenſion or inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his diuine will to the effectua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of any good effect, which might redound to the felicitie of man: yet for the attaining of the end, which out of his vnſearchable wiſdome hee hath prefixed, hee oftentimes permitteth the contrary to this his diuine inclination and will; the which therefore is called <hi>Gods permiſsiue will.</hi> As for example, God would that all men ſhould bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, according to that of the Apoſtle,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:17022:165"/> 
                  <hi>Deus vult omnes homines ſaluos fieri;</hi> to wit, in his vniuerſall grace, calling, and inſpirations, and other generall meanes, offered to all, ſo that out of his infinite goodneſſe hee wiſheth and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in this ſort all to bee ſaued, and that hee might the more manifeſt his infinite mercy by the efficacie of his working will, he actually ſaueth ſome, euen ſo to manifeſt his iuſtice by his other permiſſiue decree, he permitteth others to worke their owne ruine and eternall damnation.</p>
               <p>So that according to this diſtinction, it may truly be ſaid, that the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Adam</hi> was in ſome ſort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the will of God, in ſome againe agreeable to the ſame: for firſt, in that it was permitted by God, it was for the further benefit vnto mankinde, and the greater glory of God, by which hee wrought that miraculous effect of the hypoſtaticall vnion betweene the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon of the bleſſed Trinitie, and our nature, taking occaſion of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt euill to worke our greateſt good: inſomuch that it may well bee deemed
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:17022:166"/> (as <hi>Gregory</hi> tearmeth it) <hi>foelix culpa, quae talem &amp; tantum habere meruit Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptorem;</hi> a happy fall in regard of the iſſue, not as it was a ſinne, but as an occaſion of a more perfect aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſinne; neither as willed by God, but permitted; foreſeene by Gods wiſdome, effected by mans wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yea in ſome ſort effected by God, to wit, by Gods vniuerſall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, but determined by mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued will, Gods action being indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, or rather of its owne nature, and as Gods, ordained to good, but by mans depraued will determined to euill; which yet againe by the infinite goodneſſe of God is made an occaſion of our greateſt good. So that, if it bee demanded, whether God would that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould eat of the forbidden tree, or no? and if hee would, why did hee forbid it? if he would not, why did he not hinder it?</p>
               <p>The anſwer is, that in ſome ſort hee would it, and againe after ſome ſort he would it not: hee would it not, as a ſinne; hee would it neuertheleſſe as a
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:17022:166"/> meane, or rather as an occaſion of a greater good. Wherefore he forbad it as a ſinne: he concurred with it, as vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall cauſe of all things being, not as a particular cauſe, or agent in ſinne, as it was ſinne, though in ſome ſenſe hee would it (as hath beene ſaid) as a meane of an infinite greater good: and as the greateſt occaſion of ſhewing his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſdome, and goodneſſe; of his wiſdome, becauſe he knew to produce ſuch an excellent effect, of ſo infinite an euill; of his goodneſſe likewiſe, in that being moued onely by it, and for it, he was pleaſed to effect our greateſt good, of the greateſt euill: a worke ſo excellent and admirable, as which could onely proceede and flow from that onely infinite ocean of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Yea Adams eating of the forbidden fruit was an euident argument, that hee remained free to ſinne, euen after his ſinne: according to the pleaſure and will of God: for ſuch was his diuine will, that Adam ſhould be endued with free will, that it might be in his power
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:17022:167"/> to chuſe the good, and eſchew the euill, not of himſelfe, but by grace: ſo that thus ſinning he ſhewed his power, and conſequently by the ſame ſinne hee ſhewed in ſome ſort himſelf to remaine according to Gods diuine will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with freedome to ſinne: for ſeeing that no ſinne can be committed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome actuall exerciſe of free will, and that by the ſame exerciſe the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent power is manifeſted, it followeth, that by this exerciſe, and action of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams free will, I meane his tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it was made manifeſt, that hee was created, and alwaies preſerued accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his diuine will, in that he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, and afterward remained with free will ſufficient to ſinne, though inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in it ſelfe to the actions of grace.</p>
               <p>In this ſenſe then wee ſee that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Adam ſinned, yet remained he according to Gods will, becauſe hee remained alwaies endued with free will.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, we may vnderſtand in an other ſenſe, how Adam remained ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:17022:167"/> to Gods will, yea and this euen in regard of his ſinne; I meane, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his permiſſiue will: for Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God (as we haue ſaid before) out of his incomprehenſible wiſdome fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing the infinite good, which might proceed from thence, to wit, the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaticall vnion, and being determined by his abſolute and ſecret will, to effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuate the ſame, hee permitted this ſinne of Adam, as a negatiue meanes, or rather occaſion, of ſo excellent an end.</p>
               <p>But God (ſaith this heretike) would haue had man to haue perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in that bleſſed eſtate, from which neuertheleſſe hee fell: how then was not Gods will more then his power, ſeeing hee obtained not, that which he would?</p>
               <p>But here we may ſee both the malice and ignorance of this heretike, which both are the rootes and ſprings of all hereſies: his malice, in that hee preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againſt God himſelfe; his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, in that hee taxeth that hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:17022:168"/> not: for if he had vnderſtood either what belongeth to the free will of man, or rightly apprehended the power &amp; wiſdom of the omnipotent, he might eaſily haue perceiued, that the fall of our firſt father, did rather demonſtrate the wiſdome of God, then contradict his omnipotence, and will: for ſeeing it pleaſed his diuine maieſtie to giue vs free will, and to place vs in ſuch eſtate, in which by his grace we might perſiſt, and which being rejected, we might fall of our ſelues: what can bee more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but as that our perſeuerance ſhould haue beene attributed to God, and to the right uſe of his grace, ſo our fall onely vnto our ſelues, and the want of our concourſe with his grace, the which in that eſtate was not onely ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, but very abundant. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was once in the power of our firſt father, to haue withſtood the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation of Satan; and not to haue caſt off ſo eaſie a yoke, as was impoſed him, with ſo abundant grace; he deſerued no doubt to bee depriued of that grace,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:17022:168"/> thruſt out of Paradiſe, yea finally to bee diſrobed of the beautifull robe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie.</p>
               <p>In the combination of which we may magnifie, and admire the omnipotent wiſdome, and infinite wiſe power of God, in that hee knew and could ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently combine iuſtice, with mercy; the which two attributes, as they are to be found in all his workes, ſo without all queſtion moſt admirable in this: his iuſtice, in not leauing vnpuniſhed ſo foule a fact as originall ſinne; his mercy, in the mercifull manner of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: his iuſtice againe, in that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued man of the veſture of immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie; his mercy, euen in the ſame pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty and depriuation of immortalitie, leaſt as <hi>Moyſes Barſephas</hi> doth moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently anſwer in this point, <hi>ne ipſius prauitas foret immortalis, qualis eſt dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boli: leaſt his wickednes ſhould become immortall, ſuch as the Diuels is, following the nature of the ſubiect, to which it is adherent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore God therefore puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:17022:169"/> man with this mercifull puniſhment of death, that thereby hee conſidering the effect, might eſchew the cauſe: or laſtly, becauſe out of this mortalitie of man he would produce a more perfect immortalitie in the ſame man: for God fore-ſeeing that out of Adams poſterity ſhould come an infinite multitude of martyrs, the ſentence of death was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt Adam, to the end that many of his poſteritie ſuffering death for the Redeemers ſake, might ſupply the places of falne ſpirits.</p>
               <p>But that we may returne from whence we digreſſed, if God were therefore to be counted deficient in power, becauſe he created Adam with ſuch liberty, that he could contradict the commandment of his Creator: after the ſame manner might likewiſe be inferred, that now alſo he hath the like defect, or impotencie; ſeeing that now alſo man hath the like liberty to tranſgreſſe: becauſe as hee commanded Adam, that he ſhould not touch the tree of the knowledge of good and euill: ſo likewiſe hath hee
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:17022:169"/> commanded vs his poſteritie, that wee ſhould follow the good, and eſchew the contrary euill: now therefore if we do tranſgreſſe this law, it muſt needs bee God either allowing or contradicting this tranſgreſſion: if it be by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, why doth hee prohibite it? if contrary to his will, why doth he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it? or if hee permit that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his will, how can ſuch a God bee called omnipotent? or laſtly, if he can hinder that which is euill, and doth not; how is he good, who conſenteth, and concurreth ſo euill?</p>
               <p>To theſe I anſwer out of the former principles, that euen this permiſſion of ſinne doth moſt manifeſtly demonſtrate the infinite wiſdome, power, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God; his wiſdome, in that out of this in a manner ſo infinite euill, hee did worke ſuch an infinite good, as is the manifeſtation of his glory, and the incarnation of his Sonne; his power, in that he could, his goodneſſe in that hee would.</p>
               <p>But why (ſaith the aduerſarie) did God prohibite Adam the eating of the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:17022:170"/> tree of the knowledge of good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill? what elſe could bee his meaning, but leaſt he ſhould be able to iudge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene good and euill, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leaſt hee ſhould eſchew the euill, and proſecute the good? how then is not God enuious, or how can hee be God, who enuieth and prohibiteth that which is good?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that God did neither abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely decree that Adam ſhould eat of this fruit, neither that he ſhould not eat, though he did command him, that hee ſhould not eat, but left him to his owne free will to eat, or not eat: hee did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid him to eat, not becauſe the fruit was morally, or of it ſelfe good or euill, but in the iſſue; good, if he had abſtained; euill, if hee abſtained not: good by obedience, euill by diſobedience: where fore God did intend in this prohibition to try his obedience, and that only was reſpected in this commandement: ſo that if Adam had obeyed God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly as was in his power by the grace of God, hee ſhould for a time haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed that terrene Paradiſe, in which he
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:17022:170"/> was created, and afterward haue beene partaker of the celeſtiall eternally with his Creator.</p>
               <p>Hence wee ſee how impiouſly God is accuſed of wickedneſſe, and enuie in the forbidding of our firſt fathers the eating of the tree of good and euill; ſeeing that the eating of this fruit was indifferent of its owne nature, as out of which neither good nor euill could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed: but that which God did regard in this commandment, was our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or diſobedience: in reſpect of which hee was after a manner indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, neither abſolutely decreeing the one, neither effectually willing the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: onely this wee may adde, that God did deſire and will our firſt fathers abſtinence, and therein required his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; but as this his diuine will had not his efficacie, ſo did hee and might permit the contrary for other reſpects worthy his diuine prouidence and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſdome, which haue been already touched. Not of enuie (as ſome haue blaſphemouſly imagined) leaſt Adam become immortall, for if this blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:17022:171"/> were conſequent to the fore-ſaid prohibition; certainely, God, who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw all future euents, either would not haue created man, or hauing created him, would not haue placed him in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe ſo neere vnto the tree of life; or at leaſt way, hee might either haue hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or not haue created the tree of life. Wherefore the true reaſon, why he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad him the tree of life, was (as <hi>Moyſes Barſephas</hi> well noteth) <hi>ne perpetuò viue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret in peccato,</hi> leaſt he ſhould liue in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall death of ſinne, as the Deuill doth, euer liuing, euer dying.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the aduerſarie obiecteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the curſe of the Serpent: for why (ſaith he) did God curſe the Serpent? if hee curſed him as the author of the euill committed, why did he not hinder it, leaſt it ſhould be committed? but if he curſed him as author of that good, which was conſequent vnto the euill, how is that God called good, and not rather enuious and wicked, who puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, yea enuieth the author of ſuch an excellent effect? Againe, if neither of theſe was the cauſe of the Serpents
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:17022:171"/> curſe, how may God bee excuſed of wilfull maliciouſneſſe, or malicious fooliſhnes?</p>
               <p>The anſwer to this blaſphemy is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent out of that, which hath beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid out of the former obiections, to wit, that God did therefore curſe the Serpent as author of euill, neither did hinder him pretending the euill to the intent, that he might out of ſo infinite an euill, as was the tranſgreſſion of the firſt Adam, worke that infinite good of the incarnation of his Sonne, and birth of the ſecond Adam: for though it be an argument both of his power, and goodneſſe; <hi>ex bono efficere melius,</hi> of good to make better: yet it ſeemeth much more excellent, and conuincing euen our naturall capacitie, that hee is infinitely potent, and good: who can <hi>ex nihilo perfectiſsimum producere effectu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: vel ex peſsimo efficere optimum;</hi> who can (I ſay) produce the moſt perfect, good, and moſt excellent effect, yea farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding all other created perfection and excellencie, of nothing; yea euen of that nothing which is moſt remote

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>MAnes</hi> that wicked heretike, with the reſt of his ſect doe moſt blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly accuſe the wiſdom of God, as touching the fore-ſaid commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of abſtaining from the tree of good and euill: for (ſaith he) doubtles when God did giue this law, vnto our firſt fathers, hee thought, that they would obey it; which ſeeing they did not, God (as <hi>Manes</hi> obiecteth) was deceiued.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he accuſeth God of vniuſt wrath and indignation: in that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned man for ſo ſmall a matter, as
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:17022:172"/> the eating of an apple. Finally, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth him of ignorance, mutabilitie, and contradiction to himſelfe; in that ignoring his future compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man, hee did fruſtrate the law, which hee himſelfe had made, yea and contradicted the ſentence of death, as raſhly pronounced by himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Adam.</p>
               <p>Here we may ſee, how (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith) God of his infinite goodnes and mercy ſuffereth himſelfe to bee diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in his other infinite attributes, and dietie: but that it may bee appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that theſe blaſphemies haue not any ground, euen in naturall reaſon: we anſwer, that though all things, and conſequently the diſobedience of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam was perfectly fore-knowne by God Almighty, yet neuertheleſſe it was conformable to reaſon, that Adam being a reaſonable creature ſhould haue this law of obedience preſcribed vnto him, ſo conformable to reaſon: firſt, for to manifeſt the abſolute power, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and authoritie of God the Creator ouer his creature; and the due
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:17022:173"/> ſubiection of the creature towards his Creator.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this law of obedience was moſt profitable vnto man (though fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne that it was to be violated by man) moſt profitable (I ſay) it was, both in regard of the manifeſtation of Gods iuſtice, and mercy: as alſo for the exerciſe and tryall of the good, and bad; righteous, and vnrighteous, a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie obiect of the afore-ſaid attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.</p>
               <p>Now if this law ſhould therefore haue beene omitted, becauſe God fore-knew the tranſgreſſion thereof; by the ſame reaſon, or rather no reaſon, no other law ſhould haue beene preſcribed vnto man; ſeeing there is no law, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of nature or grace, which God in his fore-knowledge did not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee would be often-times violated by man.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, as touching the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie againſt the wrath of God, I anſwer, that it is not to be attributed to God, as ſignifying any paſſion, or mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the immutable or impaſſible
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:17022:173"/> God; but that this ſhadow of change, or ſhew of mutabilitie, is attributed vnto him, who in his nature is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther immutable, becauſe hee ſeeing the wickedneſſe of man, he worketh thoſe effects, which in vs bee euident to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, and ſignes of mutabilitie and change.</p>
               <p>Nay ſecondly, I adde, that after A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam had tranſgreſſed the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, God pronounced againſt him the afore-ſaid ſentence of death, more moued by mercy, then of any anger or wrath: which wee may eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſee in that hee did not die the ſame day of his tranſgreſſion, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the ſentence, which God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt him, ſeemed to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; ſo that whether wee reſpect the ſentence giuen before Adams diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or the execution of the ſame after his ſinne, we may admire the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercy of the Almighty in both, both in regard of Adam, and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie; as alſo in regard of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence threatned to be inflicted ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after their ſinne: ſo that euen
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:17022:174"/> in his iuſtice wee may magnifie his mercy, and ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſericordia eius ſuper omnia opera eius,</hi> that his mercy aboundeth in all his workes, yea and is aboue all his works: becauſe (as the Diuines ſay) <hi>remunerat vltra condignum, punit citra condignum,</hi> he rewardeth our workes farre beyond their worth, which is none at all, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it bee in Chriſt; and puniſheth our ſinnes much leſſe, then they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue.</p>
               <p>To the other blaſphemie, which <hi>Manes</hi> vſeth againſt the Almighty God, in accuſing him of repentance, and mutabilitie, I anſwer, that we muſt firſt ſuppoſe, what it is to repent, or to be ſorry for any thing, which wee haue done: For repentance or ſorrow ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth ignorance in vs, of future euents, yea of ſuch as are noxious or hurtfull to thoſe who are affected with the afore-ſaid paſſion; both which are farre vnfitting the all-ſeeing ſcience, and omnipotent power of God: who did not remit the rigour of this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, moued by ſorrow or repentance,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:17022:174"/> as it happeneth in vs, but rather, as we haue ſaid before, by his infinite mercy and clemencie, to the end that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodneſſe and mercy might bee the more manifeſt vnto vs.</p>
               <p>In like manner wee may ſay, that when any ſinner doth turne from his former being in ſinne, God Almightie in ſome ſort may bee ſaid to remit the rigour of his ſentence pronounced againſt him; and this not by reaſon of any ignorance, or mutable repenting himſelfe of the former fact, or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (as <hi>Manes</hi> blaſphemouſly obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth) but rather hee remitteth out of his infinite clemencie, the ſentence of damnation, which conditionally hee had decreed, to wit, if the ſinner had not repented himſelfe of his ſinne: an example of which wee finde in the commination of doome and vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction threatned not abſolutely, but conditionally againſt the <hi>Niuiuites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ionae 3.</note> that they ſhould vtterly bee deſtroied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in forty dayes,<note place="margin">4. Reg. 20.</note> likewiſe againſt <hi>Ezechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> that hee ſhould die for his ſinnes, whom neuertheleſſe God pardoned
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:17022:175"/> vpon their repentance: and the like al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo wee finde in others, moſt hainous offenders, againſt whom God hauing denounced his wrath, neuertheleſſe pardoned vpon their ſorrow, contriſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and humiliation.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the lie, which this hereticke obiecteth againſt God, in that hee threatned death vnto man in the day of his tranſgreſſion, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe was not inflicted: I anſwer, that as man is compoſed of body and ſpirit, ſo likewiſe the death threatned againſt him was both corporall and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall; which both were in ſome ſort inflicted euen in the very inſtant of his tranſgreſſion: the ſpirituall in the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his ſpirit from God and his grace, wherein conſiſted his ſpirituall and ſupernaturall life: the corporall in the perturbation of his affections and powers both ſpirituall and corporall, which was a kinde of beginning of a neuer dying death, beginning in this life, and which according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent iuſtice of God, if it had beene ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, was to haue beene conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:17022:175"/> in the other life, or rather eternall death, if ſo be that this firſt lapſe and fall had not been remitted, not of mans merit, but by Gods mercy.</p>

How then is it poſſible, vnleſſe God can contradict and denie himſelfe, or that one of the diuine decrees can be oppoſite to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that God ſhould firſt decree the
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:17022:176"/> immortalitie of man, then preſently vpon his tranſgreſſion, the obiect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing changed, God alſo ſhould be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in his decree: for either God fore-knew mans fall, and his perſeuerance in grace for ſo ſmall a ſpace, or hee fore-knew it not: if not, how was hee God? if hee fore-knew it, how is hee ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently changed, and conſequently alſo no God?</p>
               <p>Againe, if we were depriued of the gift of immortalitie beſtowed vpon <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him vpon all his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, how may it ſtand with the iuſtice of God, and much more with his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy, that wee ſhould be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>Adams</hi> iniuſtice, the innocent for the guiltie, the iuſt for the vniuſt? Yea how ſtandeth this euen with the word of God, and his complaint by <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> chapter 18. verſe 2. where God complaineth of this, as it ſeemeth, blaſphemie of his people: <hi>What meane you, that you vſe this prouerbe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the land of Iſrael, ſaying, The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue eaten ſowre grapes, and the childrens teeth are ſet on edge?</hi> which
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:17022:176"/> is as much, as to ſay, our fore-fathers haue ſinned, and wee are puniſhed for their ſinnes. How may this ſtand with the iuſtice of God, ſeeing God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe taxeth this as vniuſt, and as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly obiected againſt him, in the third verſe of the ſame chapter, where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting againſt mans vnrighteouſneſſe, hee proteſteth and proueth his owne righteouſneſſe and iuſt dealing, inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating thereby, yea deteſting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary as iniuſtice, verſe 3. <hi>As I liue, ſaith the Lord, yee ſhall not haue occaſion any more to vſe this prouerbe in Iſrael,</hi> to wit, that <hi>the fathers haue eaten ſowre grapes, and the childrens teeth are ſet on edge;</hi> that is, that their fathers haue ſinned, and they were puniſhed: againſt which hee conteſteth, and that by an oath, euen by himſelfe, in the latter end of the fourth verſe, <hi>The ſoule that ſinneth, it ſhall die,</hi> that is, all that ſinne ſhall die, and none ſhall die but thoſe which ſinne: hee giueth the reaſon in the beginning of the verſe, and that with an <hi>ecce,</hi> behold, becauſe he would haue all to acknowledge his iuſtice with
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:17022:177"/> man, and how hee vſeth equalitie with all men; the father as the ſonne, and the ſonne as the father, euery one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his deeds in Chriſt, becauſe all are equally his, who ſaith, <hi>Behold, all ſoules are mine; as the ſoule of the father, ſo alſo the ſoule of the ſonne is mine; the ſoule that ſinneth, it ſhall die:</hi> as who would ſay, and none elſe ſhall die, but who ſinneth; which may bee proued by the oppoſite iuſtice, and is exemplified euen by the Prophet, as that none ſhall bee rewarded for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers righteouſneſſe, ſo none ſhall bee puniſhed for anothers vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: for ſo the Prophet proſecuteth in the fift verſe: <hi>But if a man bee iuſt, and doe that which is lawfull and right, and hath not eaten vpon the mountaines, neither lift vp his eyes vnto idols of the houſe of Iſrael, neither hath defiled his neighbours wife, neither hath come neere a menſtruous woman, and hath not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed any, but hath reſtored to the debter his pledge, hath ſpoiled none by violence, hath giuen his bread to the hungrie, and hath couered the naked with

               </p>
               <p>How then can it bee true that <hi>Adams</hi> poſteritie ſhould bee puniſhed for his ſinne, or depriued of immortalitie, which God had decreed vnto them for <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion? Or otherwiſe how can that bee true which the ſame Prophet proſecuteth in the twentieth verſe? <hi>The ſoule that ſinneth, it ſhall die: the ſonne ſhall not beare the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of the father, neither ſhall the father beare the iniquitie of the ſonne: the righteouſneſſe of the righteous ſhall be vpon him, and the wickedneſſe of the wicked ſhall bee vpon him.</hi> Where hee proſecuteth throughout all the chapter, prouing and approuing the iuſtice of God, together with the reproofe of mans vnrighteouſneſſe and iniuſtice, eſpecially from the 29. verſe to the end,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:17022:178"/> where hee propoundeth and anſwereth the obiections of his people: <hi>Yet (ſaith the houſe of Iſrael) the way of the Lord is not equall: O houſe of Iſrael, are not my wayes equall? are not your wayes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall? Therefore I will iudge you, O houſe of Iſrael, euery one according to his wayes, ſaith the Lord God: repent and turne your ſelues from all your tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſo iniquitie ſhall not bee your ruine; caſt away from you all your tranſgreſsions, whereby you haue tranſgreſſed, and make you a new heart, and a new ſpirit: for why will you die, O houſe of Iſrael? for I haue no pleaſure in the death of him that dieth, ſaith the Lord God: wherefore turne your ſelues, and liue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then if God haue no pleaſure in the death of a ſinner, how hath hee pleaſure in his mortalitie, hauing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him immortall? or how hath hee not pleaſure in his death, whom for ſo ſmall a matter as the eating of an apple, or ſome other ſuch like fruit, hee depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth of immortalitie, yea contradicteth his owne decree for the fulfilling of the aforeſaid reuenge of ſinne?</p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:17022:178"/>
               <p>Againe, though wee grant that <hi>Adam</hi> died for his ſinne and iniuſtice, why ſhould wee not likewiſe ſay, that <hi>Noe, Melchiſedech, Abraham,</hi> and others of the Patriarkes and Prophets were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored vnto immortalitie for their iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and righteouſneſſe? Wee know that God is alwayes more prone to ſhew his mercy, then to execute his iuſtice: how then may it bee ſaid, that here he ſo withdraweth his mercy, and extendeth his iuſtice? Hee often par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth the wicked for the godly mens ſake, and neuer puniſheth the iuſt for the wickeds ſinne: from whence then is this his crueltie and vniuſt dealing againſt thoſe which neuer committed any iniuſtice?</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the ſonne of God was incarnate for <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne: we ought to bee thankfull euen to the deuill, to our ſelues, and to ſinne it ſelfe, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſo great good, as was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of mankinde to a more bleſſed eſtate.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne was cauſe of his death, why did not the deuils alſo
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:17022:179"/> die, ſeeing they ſinned much more grieuouſly? If you ſay they died ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, in that they were depriued of the grace of God, why might not the like death ſuffice alſo for <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne? the death (I meane) of the ſoule, his body remaining as it was created, not ſubiect to death? How did God iuſtly execute his iuſtice, inflicting a greater puniſhment vpon <hi>Adam</hi> for a ſmaller offence, then vpon the deuils for a greater, depriuing them only of their ſpirituall life, but <hi>Adam</hi> both of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and corporall?</p>
               <p>Theſe are the arguments of theſe heretickes, againſt the iuſt puniſhment which God did inflict vpon our firſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his firſt offence of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; by which they would conclude, that whether <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in his former righteouſneſſe, whether hee had eaten of the forbidden fruit, or abſtained from it, hee had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe beene ſubiect to death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee was created of his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mortall, which nature neither the eating of the forbidden fruit could
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:17022:179"/> make mortall, nor the abſtinence from it immortall.</p>
               <p>Hence therefore they are imboldned to affirme, that whereſoeuer the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture maketh mention of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, as cauſe of his corporall death, that it is to bee vnderſtood figuratiuely, not that <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne was properly the cauſe or the occaſion of his death, but that the Scripture vſeth this phraſe, to the end, that when <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould heare of ſo ſeuere a puniſhment, as the death of both body and ſoule, he might bee terrified thereby from the committing of ſinne. The Scripture vſeth the like manner of ſpeech in diuers occaſions, as in the 22. chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> God tempted or tried <hi>Abraham,</hi> which place muſt needs be vnderſtood figuratiuely; for God who ſeeth all things, as well future, as preſent, or paſt, hath no need of any triall or experience. The like kinde of threatning wee haue in the fourth chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> where it is ſaid, that God would haue ſlaine <hi>Moſes,</hi> which places are not to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted literally as they ſound, but
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:17022:180"/> figuratiuely, as all other places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (according to the rule of <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>) when otherwiſe they ſignifie any abſurditie, as this of the death of <hi>Adam</hi> doth, becauſe it contradicteth the decree of God concerning his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe the contrary expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is moſt firmly to bee holden as concerning the immortalitie of man before his fall, and mortalitie after and by his tranſgreſſion: not that there was any mutation in God, but tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion in man: God predetermined according to his foreſight, man ſinned according to that foreſight, not that the foreſight was cauſe of mans fall, but rather mans fall was the obiect of Gods foreſight: inſomuch that God had not foreſeene mans fall, if man had not beene to fall; neither man had fallen, if God had not foreſeene his fall: ſo that though it bee neceſſary that God foreſee that which is future, yet that is not neceſſarily future, which God doth foreſee; for ſo ſeeth hee things future as they are future, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:17022:180"/> any neceſſitie in things not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily future by his foreſight: which as it is neceſſary in regard of things neceſſary, ſo is it contingent in regard of things contingent: contingent (I ſay) in reſpect of the obiect, though neceſſary in reſpect of his owne entitie and being; or as the Schoole-Diuines doe explicate it, <hi>ad intra</hi> neceſſary, <hi>ad extra</hi> contingent: inſomuch that all the mutation is in the outward and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated obiects, nothing at all can reflect or redound vnto God.</p>
               <p>Wherefore though Almighty God had eternally decreed the immortalitie of man in his firſt creation; yet was there no mutation in God, becauſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his tranſgreſſion he made him mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and ſubiect to death: for as both the degrees were eternall, ſo the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of the euent of both was likewiſe eternall; the mutation iſſued onely from the obiect, and remained in the ſame: immutabilitie was alwayes, and remaineth in God, becauſe as hee had foreſeene, ſo he determined; and as he determined, ſo likewiſe he foreſaw.</p>
               <pb n="352" facs="tcp:17022:181"/>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Lege ad Rom. cap. 5. &amp; 7.</note>Hence it is is, that ſeeing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo often witneſſeth, that death was the effect of ſinne, and that if ſinne had not raigned in our ſoules, neither ſhould death haue deſtroied our mortall bodies; queſtionleſſe, though man was created immortall by grace, yet is hee iuſtly depriued of that immortalitie, and become ſubiect to death through his tranſgreſſion.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the abſurdities ſo ignorantly (if not blaſphemouſly) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vpon the foreſaid doctrine, I anſwer, that though God doe reproue that ancient prouerbe of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and their compariſon of the ſowre grape, with other the like conteſtations of ſillie wormes with their Creator, that theſe (I ſay) are principally to bee vnderſtood in regard of actuall ſinne, as is plaine out of the text it ſelfe, and not habituall or originall, of which the text ſpeaketh not.</p>
               <p>But if it bee referred (as ſome haue done) euen vnto originall ſinne, yet neither can the iuſtice of God bee any whit impeached thereby: for though
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:17022:181"/> wee eat not the ſowre grape, neither taſte the forbidden fruit in our ſelues, yet did we both taſte and eat in <hi>Adam,</hi> who was our head: yea though wee taſted not the fruit it ſelfe in our ſelues, yet we contracted the ſowreneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the effect of the ſinne, yea the ſinne it ſelfe in our ſoules: for though the action was onely in our head, yet the paſſion, and effect was in all the members; as is more largely explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aboue in the queſtion of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nature, and eſſence of this ſinne, in which all the difficulties concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this and the like points are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
               <p>Neither can it bee inferred hence, that God doth puniſh the iuſt for the vniuſt, or reuenge the fathers wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the ſonnes: (which neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe were no iniuſtice, ſeeing the ſonnes are in ſome ſort deemed as parts of the fathers, and conſequently may iuſtly be puniſhed for their fathers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences) but rather that euery man is puniſhed for his owne originall ſinne; which though it bee contracted from
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:17022:182"/> 
                  <hi>Adam,</hi> yet it is inherent in euery mans owne nature.</p>
               <p>Againe, ſeeing <hi>Adam</hi> of his owne nature was created mortall, and by grace onely was to bee preſerued im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, there was no iniuſtice in God towards <hi>Adams</hi> poſteritie in that they were depriued of originall iuſtice, but this proceeded from <hi>Adams</hi> demerit for himſelfe, and his poſteritie. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeeing that the couenant was ſo concluded betweene GOD and <hi>Adam,</hi> that <hi>qua die comederet, moriretur,</hi> that his eating ſhould be his death; his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence, life: with this difference that death ſhould be onely from himſelfe, as ſinne had beene onely from his will, but life ſhould haue beene onely from God, and the preſeruation from ſinne, from Gods grace onely.</p>
               <p>Hence wee may vnderſtand how there is no iniuſtice or vnrighteouſneſſe in God, that although <hi>Adam</hi> was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted immortall, yet we ſhould be borne of <hi>Adam</hi> mortall, and ſubiect to death: ſeeing hee was iuſtly depriued of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie by his ſin, and we by him.</p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:17022:182"/>
               <p>Laſtly, if we read the ſacred text, we ſhall finde it neither to be iniuſtice, or any nouelty that the ſonnes be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their fathers offences; for ſo it is in the 1. of <hi>Samuel</hi> the 15. <hi>becauſe I remember that which Amalech did vnto Iſrael, going out of Aegypt, goe thou Saul, and fight againſt Agag, and his people:</hi> and the 2. of <hi>Samuel</hi> 18, it is ſaid, <hi>that the wiues of Dauid ſhould be defiled for Dauids ſinne.</hi> againe in the 2 of <hi>Samuel</hi> the 21 it is written, how <hi>Dauid</hi> hanged the ſonnes of <hi>Reſphe</hi> for the <hi>Gabaonites</hi> ſake.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if it were true that which the Poet ſang vnto his friend; <hi>delicta maiorum immeritus lues:</hi> thou ſhalt beare the offences of thy fore-fathers without thine owne deſeruings, then certainely the queſtion,<note place="margin">B. King <hi>vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Ionas, cap. <hi>1.</hi> v. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> as a reuerend and learned Prelate well noteth, were more difficult, but who is able to ſay, <hi>my heart is cleane,</hi> though I came from an vncleane ſeede? though I were borne of a Morian, I haue not his ſinne: though an Amorite were my father, and my mother a Hittite, I haue not
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:17022:183"/> their nature: though I haue touched pitch, I am not defiled: I can waſh my hands in innocencie, and ſay with a cleare conſcience, I haue not ſinned? but if this be the cauſe of all, that there is not a ſoule in the whole cluſter of mankinde, that hath not offended, though not as principall as <hi>Achan</hi> in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the curſed thing, <hi>Choran</hi> in rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Dauid</hi> in numbring the people, yet as acceſſarie in conſenting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing; if neither principall nor acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie in that one ſinne, yet culpable in a thouſand others committed in our life time, (perhaps not open to the world, but in the eyes of God as bright as the Sunne in the firmament; for the Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion hath a ſting, though hee hath not thruſt it out to wound vs, and man hath malice, though hee hath not outwardly ſhewed it) it may be ſome ſinnes to come which God fore-ſeeth; and ſome paſt, which he recounteth, ſhall we ſtand in argument with God, as man would plead with man, and charge the iudge of the quicke and the dead with iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exactions? <hi>I haue paied the things,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:17022:183"/> that I neuer tooke,</hi> I haue borne the price of ſinne, which I neuer committed? You ſee already the ground of mine anſwere.</p>
               <p>We haue all ſinned father and ſonne, ruſh and branch, and deſeruedly are to expect that wages from the hands of God, which to our ſinne appertaineth. Beſides it cannot be denied, but thoſe things, which we part in our conceipts, by reaſon that diſtance of time and place haue ſundered them, ſome being done of old, ſome of late, ſome in one quarter of the world, ſome in another; thoſe doth the God of knowledge v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and view them at once, as if they were done together; out of all which conceiued together (as the all-vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding wiſdome of God doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and vnite them) we may well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre that the iudgements of God bee as iuſt, and his waies as right as his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and goodneſſe, and prouidence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all, that as there is no worke of man, not fully recompenced, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with ouerplus; ſo there is no ſinne, whether actuall, or originall, not
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:17022:184"/> iuſtly puniſhed, <hi>citra,</hi> as the Diuines hold, but neuer <hi>vltra condignum,</hi> leſſe, I meane, then the ſinne doth deſerue, neuer more then the fact doth require, Gods mercy being (as the Scripture wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth) ouer all his workes; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in ſome ſort more extended then his iuſtice: for though it be true, that as his iuſtice is included in his mercy, euen formally (as moſt Diuines hold) ſo like wiſe his mercy is included in his iuſtice, and ſo both equall in nature and being: yet ſuch is the goodnes of our infinite good God, that in the execution, <hi>&amp; ad extra,</hi> (as the Diuines tearme it) his mercy ſhould alwaies be extended fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then his iuſtice, and his iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alwaies in ſomewhat at leaſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, or after a ſort reſtrained by his mercy. Wherefore as we are wont to ſay, of famous, worthy, and excellent men, <hi>in caeteris vicit omnes, in hoc ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipſum,</hi> in other things hee exceeded all men; in this, hee ouercame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; The like wee may affirme of God; that hee is incomparable, in all attributes, and workes, but in this hee
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:17022:184"/> exceedeth himſelfe. To him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as infinite, mercifull, and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuing God, three perſons and one indiviſible deitie, bee aſcribed all honor, power, maieſtie, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, now and for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.
